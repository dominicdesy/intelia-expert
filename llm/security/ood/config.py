ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLDS: Dict[str, float] = {
    "technical_query": 0.10,  # Lower threshold for technical queries with metrics
    "numeric_query": 0.15,  # Slightly higher for queries with numeric data

    "generic_query": 0.30,  # Higher threshold for generic queries
    "suspicious_query": 0.50,  # Very high threshold for suspicious content
}
"""
Adaptive thresholds for different query types.

These thresholds determine the minimum score required for a query to be
considered in-domain based on the query's characteristics:
- Technical queries (with metrics/specifications) get lower thresholds
- Generic queries require higher scores to be accepted
- Suspicious queries are held to very high standards
"""

# ===== LANGUAGE ADJUSTMENTS =====

LANGUAGE_ADJUSTMENTS: Dict[str, float] = {
    "fr": 1.0,  # French - base reference (no adjustment)

    "id": 0.85,  # Indonesian - moderate reduction
}
"""
Language-specific threshold multipliers.

These multipliers adjust the base threshold according to the detected language.
Languages with non-Latin scripts (Hindi, Thai, Chinese) get more permissive
thresholds to account for reduced vocabulary coverage and translation challenges.

The multiplier is applied to the base threshold: adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * multiplier

Fallback blocked terms when blocked_terms.json is unavailable.

These critical terms are categorized by domain and used as a last resort
to block clearly off-topic or inappropriate queries when the main
blocked terms configuration file cannot be loaded.

Universal multilingual poultry terms for fallback analysis.

These terms are recognized across languages and scripts, including:
- Genetic line names (brand names, same in all languages)
- Universal metrics (FCR, ADG, etc.)
- Poultry-related words in major languages (French, English, Spanish,
  Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic, etc.)

Used when translation service is unavailable to still provide
basic domain detection capabilities.

Technical pattern matchers for multilingual query analysis.

Each tuple contains:
1. A regex pattern to match technical indicators
2. A label describing the type of technical indicator

These patterns recognize:
- Feed conversion metrics in multiple languages
- Genetic line names with optional numeric suffixes
- Age specifications in various languages and scripts
- Weight measurements across different unit systems
- Percentage values

Weight multipliers for domain relevance levels.

These multipliers are used to calculate the weighted score when
domain words are found. Higher relevance words contribute more
to the final score. The weighted score formula is:

"""
Acronym to full-text expansions for query normalization.

Common poultry industry acronyms are expanded to their full forms
during query normalization to improve matching against the domain
vocabulary. This helps recognize queries that use abbreviated terms.

Examples:
- "IC" → "indice conversion" (conversion index)
- "FCR" → "feed conversion ratio"
- "PV" → "poids vif" (live weight)
- "GMQ" → "gain moyen quotidien" (average daily gain)
