                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The Parties hereto hereby declare that they intend the provisions of this Agreement to apply fairly and without detriment to the interests of any of them, and agree to use their best endeavors to give effect to this Agreement in the spirit in which it was decided. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity, question of intent, or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party based on the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

                  No failure or delay (i) in exercising any right or remedy, or (ii) in requiring the satisfaction of any condition under this Agreement, and no act, omission, or course of dealing between the Parties operates as a waiver or estoppel of any right, remedy, or condition.
