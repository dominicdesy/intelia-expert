After soaking they should be cleaned with a pressure washer.\nAll cleaning should begin with the uppermost surfaces and proceed downwards to minimize possible re-contamination of previously cleaned areas. The house should be washed in the direction of the best drainage or along the slope of the floor.\nApply the foam or gel detergent and allow the recommended soak time so that the product has adequate time to work. Always wash from the ceiling to the floor - if ceiling fans are present, they should be washed first.\nPrevent standing water around the poultry house each farm should have adequate drainage and dirty water collection tanks that meet local environmental regulations.\nAll outside concrete areas and ends of the house should be washed completely.\nDry cleaning (i.e. brushing, scraping, vacuum cleaners, air blowers etc.) should be performed inside and outside the poultry house, farm storage, and egg rooms. While dry cleaning, pay special attention to the fans and air inlets, light system, beams (especially in corners) heating system and electrical equipment which cannot be removed (e.g. motors, switches). These difficult areas should be dry cleaned by blowing with compressed air.\nEgg collection equipment should be opened and egg belts removed. All egg debris, dust and dirt should be swept away.\nIn curtain sided houses, special attention should be given to cleaning both the inside and outside of the curtains and preventing dirt collecting in the curtain pocket. Light traps at the inlet and fan end will need special attention to remove all organic material between the ribs or fins.\nUse the pressure-washer on the house exterior to clean the fan shafts and air inlets. It is advisable to wash off the dust that accumulates on the roof and in the gutters. Be aware that high pressure water can potentially damage blades, aluminum shutters, and other soft materials. Use high pressure water pressure cautiously. Wooden community nests cannot be high pressure washed and can be damaged with excessive water pressure.",
