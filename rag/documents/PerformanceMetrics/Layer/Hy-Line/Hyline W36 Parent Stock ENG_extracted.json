For beak-treated chicks, feed on paper for 0–7 days.\nRemove paper at 7–14 days to avoid the buildup of manure.\nLitter should not be more than 5 cm deep.\nSpread litter after concrete floors have warmed.\n\n## Tray feeders\n\nUse a ratio of 80 chicks / feeder.\nUse good quality crumble starter feed consisting of uniform 1–2 mm particles.\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of an automatic feeding and watering system in a brooder ring.)\n\n## Management\n\nEnlarge brooder rings at 3 days to increase group size.\nContinue enlarging brooder rings until rings are removed by 14 days.\nGradually remove supplemental drinkers and tray feeders beginning at 3 days.\n\n## Partial House Brooding\n\n(A section of rearing house is partitioned and used for brooding) Automatic drinkers Automatic feeders 60 cm high barrier Tray feeders 80 chicks / feeder Paper over slat or litter floor Supplemental chick drinkers 80 chicks / 25 cm diameter drinker Curtain Partial house brooding provides uniform temperature to chicks **CORRECT** Chicks evenly distributed in brooding area, active and sounding content **HOT** Chicks spread out, lethargic; appear sleeping **COLD** Chicks gathered into groups sounding distressed **UNEVEN VENTILATION** Chicks congregated in one part of brooding area, avoiding drafts, noise or uneven light distribution\n\n## Cage Brooding\n\nPlace feed on cage paper 0–3 days to encourage consumption. For beak-treated chicks, feed on paper for 0–7 days.\nPaper should cover entire floor.\nPlace feed in front of permanent feeder to train chicks to move toward feeders.\nFill automatic feed line to its highest level and adjust chick guards; allow access to automatic feed line from first day.\nRemove paper by 7–14 days of age to avoid build-up of feces.\nRearing cage should be constructed of 2 mm diameter wire with spacing between wires to provide maximum cell size\nof 18 mm x 18 mm.\nCage floors should not be slippery or sloped.\nRearing cage height should be minimum of 48 cm. If too low, males may experience leg problems and keel bone\npressure sores.\nStart chicks in upper tiered cages which are usually warmer and brighter. Ensure there are no shadows on drinkers.\nChicks from young breeder flocks should be placed in warmer and brighter areas of the house.\nChicks' body weight should double between arrival on farm and 7 days of age.\nUse vitamins and electrolytes in chicks' water (avoid sugar-based products to prevent growth of microorganisms).\nPullets reared in cages should be transferred to breeder cages with similiar feeder and drinker types.\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of a cage with chicks and feeding/drinking systems.

If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0–7 days, then use 22 hours of light from 0–3 days and 21 hours of light from 4–7 days.\nDo not use 24 hours of light.\nBright light (30–50 lux) during 0–7 days helps chicks quickly find feed and water and adapt to the new environment.\nAfter the first week, begin slow step-down lighting program (see Light Program for Light-Controlled Housing).\n\n## INTERMITTENT LIGHTING PROGRAM FOR CHICKS\n\n|\n|\n| 2 hours | • Preferred lighting technique |\n| 4 hours | • Use from 0–7 days (can be used up to 14 days of age) |\n| 2 hours | • Intermittent dark periods provide rest periods for chicks |\n| 4 hours | • Synchronizes chicks' activities and feedings |\n| 2 hours | • Establishes more natural behavior of rest and activity |\n| 4 hours | • May improve 7 day livability and pullet body weight |\n| • May improve antibody response from vaccinations |\n| • Some dark periods may be shortened or removed to accommodate work schedules |\n\n## Drinking Systems\n\nDrinking water should be tested for quality and cleanliness from source and end of the water line.\nFlush water lines weekly during the brooding period, starting the day prior to chick arrival. Flush water lines weekly during rearing and production periods.\nDo not give cold water to chicks. Be careful when flushing water lines for chicks. Allow water time to warm up in the house so chicks are comfortable drinking.\nFlush chick water lines at night to allow water to warm in water lines.\nMaintain water temperature of 20–25°C during brooding period.\nNipple drinkers should deliver minimum 60 ml per minute/nipple, with easy activation of the drinkers by chicks.\nUse the same drinker type in rearing and laying houses.\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of cup and nipple drinkers for chicks, illustrating their use and level relative to the chick.)\nCup drinkers should be manually filled during 0–3 days to train chicks to drink.\nOpen drinkers (bell, plasson, supplemental chick drinkers, trough) are easily contaminated and should be cleaned daily.\nAdjust nipple water system pressure to create hanging drop to help chicks find water for up to 3 days.\nSplash cups are useful during brooding period and in hot climates.\n360° activated nipples make drinking easy for chicks.\nUse only 360° activated nipples for hatchery beak- treated chicks, as well as supplemental chick drinkers.\n\n## Beak Treatment / Trimming *(Check local regulations concerning use of beak trimming)*\n\nHy-Line W-36 parent female is most successfully beak trimmed at hatch by infrared beak treatment or between 7-10 days\nof age by precision beak trimming.\nHy-Line W-36 male should preferably not be beak trimmed. If treatment is required, beak treat in hatchery or tip at 7-10\ndays of age.\nFemales should be re-trimmed at 6 weeks or 12-14 weeks of age.\nHatchery beak treatment or 7-10-day beak trimming reduces feed wastage and leaves the beak less damaging to other birds.\n\n## HATCHERY INFRARED BEAK TREATMENT (IRBT)\n\nThis provides efficient, uniform\nbeak treatment.\nBeak remains intact until\n10-21 days of age when\ntreated portion separates.\nUse only 360° activated nipples\nfor IRBT chicks, as well as\nsupplemental chick drinkers.\nFor IRBT chicks, feed on paper\nfor 0-7 days.\nInfrared beak treatment can be modified according to local conditions.\n\n5mm SCALE 王 Immediately following infrared 7 days after infrared beak beak treatment on day of hatch treatment\n\nIRBT is adjustable to manage\ndifferences in breeder flock age,\nchick size and variety of birds.\nFor more information, see the\n*“Infrared Beak Treatment”*\ntechnical update at www.hyline.com.\n\n## PRECISION BEAK TRIMMING\n\nCauterize beak for 2 seconds at 650°C.\nWhen cauterizing blade is not hot\nenough or cauterization time is \\< 2\nseconds, beak will continue to grow\nunevenly.\nPhoto courtesy of Lyon Technologies, Inc.\n\nPyrometer indicating proper blade temperature of 650°C.\n\nIf cauterizing blade is too hot or cauterization time\nis \\> 2 seconds, sensitive neuromas may form.\nUse a pyrometer to measure blade temperature, which\nshould be approximately 650°C.\nCauterizing blade color may be used as an approximate\nindicator of temperature.\n\\< 650°C 650°C \\> 650°C\n\nBlade temperature variation of up to 40°C is common\ndue to external influences and cannot be detected by the\nhuman eye.\nCheck that beaks have been properly and evenly\ntrimmed.\nProperly trimmed beaks Cauterizing blade (650°C, cherry red color) Template with guide holes Guide holes correspond to different size and age of chicks • 3.56 mm • 4.00 mm • 4.37 mm\n\n## Precautions when using IRBT or beak trimming birds:\n\nWater intake is the most important factor in the success of\nIRBT/beak trimming. Chicks require immediate and easy access\nto water.\nDo not beak-trim sick or stressed birds.\nDo not hurry; handle chicks carefully.\nProvide vitamins and electrolytes containing vitamin K in\ndrinking water 2 days before and 2 days after beak trimming.\nWatch chicks after beak trimming to assess stress. Raise\nambient temperature until birds appear comfortable and active.\nKeep feed at the highest level for several days after beak\ntrimming.\nUse only well-trained crews.\nUse 360° activated nipples.\nNipple drinkers with splash cups provide additional support\nfor IRBT chicks.\nProvide extra light on nipple drinkers after beak treatment.\n\n## Growth and Development\n\nFocus on pullet rearing programs to optimize growth and development.\nThe best predictor of future laying performance is the pullet's body weight and body type at the point of lay.\nThe design of the rearing facility should closely match that of the layer house to which the flock will be transferred. Drinker and feeder type and perching should match. This makes the transition of the birds from rearing to laying easy and stress-free.\nA pullet flock entering into egg production at correct body weight (females 1.18-1.22 kg) with uniformity higher than 90% performs best in the production period.\nIt is important to achieve 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 week body weight targets to ensure optimum development of the bird's body.\nIf possible, exceed pullet body weight standards throughout rear.\nUse a crumble starter feed to promote good feed intake.\nChange rearing diets only when recommended body weights are attained.\nAnticipate rapid rise in ambient temperature and adjust bird's diet accordingly. Birds will eat less when exposed to a rapid temperature increase. (See the \"Understanding Heat Stress in Layers\" technical update at www.hyline.com.)\nStress periods require change in diet formulation to ensure proper nutrient intake.\nBy 12 weeks of age, match the feeding schedule to be used in the layer house.\nDuring the rearing period, run feeders 3-5 times per day. Feed more frequently to encourage feed intake in underweight flocks or in hot weather.\nManage feeders so that additional feedings do not create excessive fine feed particles. Check feed consumption against the body weight/feed consumption table on p. 12.\nDelay diet changes if birds are underweight or have poor diet uniformity, or until after a stress-inducing event, such as catching birds for an injected vaccination.\n| | | | | WEEKS OF AGE | | | |\n| - | - | - | - | ------------ | - | - | - |\n| 1 week | 3 weeks | 6 weeks | 12 weeks | 18 weeks | 24 weeks | | |\n\n| | | | WEEKS OF AGE | | | |\n| - | - | - | ------------ | - | - | - |\n| | | | | | | | |\n\n| | | | | 1st MOLT | 2nd MOLT | 3rd MOLT | |\n| - | - | - | - | -------- | -------- | -------- | - |\n| SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT | | | Immune \\& Digestive Systems | Muscles | Ovary | Reproductive Tract | |\n| | | | | | | Fat Cells | |\n| | | Cortical Bone / Skeletal Growth | Skeletal frame developed | Sexual maturity- -------- reddening of comb and wattles | | Medullary Bone | |\n| | | | | | | Physical maturity | |\n| 2400 | | | | | | | 120 |\n| 2000 | | | | | | | 100 |\n| 1600 | | | | | | Body weight (g) | 80 |\n| 1200 | | | | | | | 60 |\n| 800 | | | | | | | 40 |\n| 400 | | | | | | | 20 |\n| 0 | | | | | | Approximate weekly weight gain (g) | 0 |\n\n| | | | | | WEEKS OF AGE | |\n| - | - | - | - | - | ------------ | - |\n| | | | | | | |\n\n| IDEAL BREAST MUSCLE SCORE | | BREAST MUSCLE SCORING | |\n| ------------------------- | - | --------------------- | - |\n| | | | |\n| | | | |\n| | | | |\n| 0 | 1-2 | 2 | 2-3 |\n| | | | 3 |\n| | | | |\n\nHens with good muscle development are better able to sustain high egg production\n\n## Rearing Body Weights, Feed Consumption and Uniformity\n\n| AGE (weeks) | FEMALE WEIGHT (g) | MALE WEIGHT (g) | FEED INTAKE (g/day per bird) | WATER CONSUMP- TION (ml/bird/day) | UNIFORMITY Floor | UNIFORMITY Cage |\n| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |\n| 1 | 61-69 | 61-69 | 12-13 | 18-26 | | |\n| 2 | 107-113 | 117-123 | 15-16 | 23-32 | \\>85% | \\>85% |\n| 3 | 171-179 | 176-184 | 18-19 | 27-38 | | |\n| 4 | 225-235 | 255-265 | 28-30 | 42-60 | | |\n| 5 | 294-306 | 369-381 | 37-39 | 56-78 | \\>80% | \\>80% |\n| 6 | 393-407 | 488-502 | 40-42 | 60-84 | | |\n| 7 | 472-488 | 627-643 | 42-44 | 63-88 | | |\n| 8 | 541-559 | 721-739 | 45-47 | 68-94 | | |\n| 9 | 640-660 | 830-850 | 47-49 | 71-98 | | |\n| 10 | 704-726 | 934-956 | 50-52 | 75-104 | \\>83% | \\>85% |\n| 11 | 768-792 | 1028-1052 | 52-54 | 78-108 | | |\n| 12 | 847-873 | 1097-1123 | 53-55 | 80-110 | | |\n| 13 | 886-914 | 1186-1214 | 55-57 | 83-114 | | |\n| 14 | 955-985 | 1265-1295 | 56-59 | 84-118 | | |\n| 15 | 1014-1046 | 1354-1386 | 58-61 | 87-122 | \\>85% | \\>85% |\n| 16 | 1083-1117 | 1418-1452 | 63-66 | 95-132 | | |\n| 17 | 1152-1188 | 1472-1508 | 69-73 | 104-146 | | |\n| 18 | 1180-1220 | 1540-1580 | 76-80 | 114-160 | \\>88% | \\>90% |\n\nMonitor body weights weekly from 0-30\nweeks and before\nscheduled diet\nchanges.\nBody weight gains\nand uniformity may\nbe negatively affected\nby inappropriate\ndiet changes, bird\nhandling, vaccination\nand transfer.\nUsing multiple hatch\ndates, causing a\nrange of chick ages,\nwill negatively affect\nuniformity.\nFlocks should be at\n85% uniformity at the\ntime of transfer to the\nlaying facility.\n!\\[Image description\\](Weigh birds separately after 3 weeks using a digital scale that calculates uniformity.)\nDuring the transfer of birds from rearing to laying facilities, there will be some loss of body weight.\n\n## Space Guidelines (check local regulations)\n\n| 3 BREEDER COLONY CAGES Floor Space 200 cm² (50 birds/m²) | WEEKS OF AGE 17 400 cm² (25 birds / m²) | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 75 750 cm² (13 birds / m²) |\n| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -------------------------- |\n| Nipple 1/12 birds | 1/8 birds | | | | | | | 1/10 birds |\n| Feeders 5 cm / bird | 9 cm/bird | | | | | | | 12 cm /bird |\n\n| SLATS/LITTER Floor Space 700 cm² (14 birds /m²) | 1000 cm² (10 birds / m²) | 1000 cm² (10 birds / m²) |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| Nipple / Cup Drinkers 1/15 birds | 1/15 birds | 1/12 birds |\n| Feeders 5 cm / bird | 5 cm/bird or 1 pan/50 birds | 12 cm / bird |\n| Perches \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ | 8 cm / bird | 12 cm / bird |\n\n| 3 | WEEKS OF AGE 17 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 75 |\n| - | --------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |\n\nRequirements vary with type of equipment used and environmental conditions. Density calculations should include all birds—males and females.\n\n## Hy-Line W-36 Male Management\n\nThe W-36 male chick is smaller than the female and will benefit from a 1°C warmer brooding temperature.\nThe W-36 male's 18-week body weight is 1.54–1.58 kg.\nThe W-36 male's adult body weight is 1.95–1.99 kg (40 weeks of age).\nThe W-36 male should be infrared beak treated at the hatchery or tipped at 7-10 days of age.\nAchieving male target body weights during rear is critical for optimum mating behavior and fertility.\nMales and females should receive the same feed and lighting schedule.\nFor breeder cages having a specific male feeder space, these spaces should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.\nMale and female breeders should reach sexual maturity at approximately the same time.\nFrom 0-4 weeks, rear males separately to improve male body weight gain.\nAt 5 weeks, mix males and females. In cages, mix 3–4 females into each male cage. If males appear weaker than females, mix males with females at a 1:1 ratio through the rearing period.\nGrading males into pens based on body weight can improve male uniformity.\nMales and females must be co-mingled during rearing period to become socialized and avoid mating problems as adults.\nKeep extra males in a separate pen; do not mix extra males with females.\nContinue culling males as needed during production.\nMaintain a mating ratio of 10 males for every 100 females throughout production in floor and cage systems.\nToo many males results in more fighting, less mating activity and disruption of social groups and lower fertility.\n!\\[Image description\\](Red vent from a mating\nW-36 male.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Vent from non-mating\nrooster.)\n\n## MALE EVALUATION – A BEAUTY CONTEST\n\n*Tall, masculine appearance with full red comb* W-36 males are dubbed in the hatchery to differentiate them from females.\n\nEvaluate males at 10 weeks and at transfer.\n\nCull roosters with:\n\nLameness\nMore than 200 g below target body weight\nCurled toes\nFoot pad lesions\nPoor feathering\nPoor beaks\nLow social ranking\nHide in nests\nFeather pecked\n\n## Cage Systems Management\n\n*(Use cage systems specifically designed for breeders)*\n\n## Advantages:\n\nCleaner hatching eggs\nBetter control of enteric diseases (coccidiosis, Gumboro, internal parasites, Salmonella)\nMore settable eggs\nBetter feed efficiency; less feed waste\nMore efficient use of breeder house space\nLower labor costs\nLower mortality\nDry manure (less flies and ammonia)\n\n## Disadvantages:\n\nHigher capital investment\nLess leg strength in cage-reared males\nLower fertility may occur, especially with smaller colony cages\n**CAUTION** – *it is not advisable to rear breeders in cages and then transfer to a floor production system. Breeders handled in this way may experience displaced pecking behavior and poor nesting behaviors as adults.*\n\n## Breeder Cage Enrichment\n\nEnriched cages address some of the welfare concerns of layers in cages by providing more space with environment enrichment devices, such as perches, nest boxes, scratch areas and abrasive pads for beak and toe shortening.\nAs group size increases, there is more competition for feed and water space and less stable social groups. This could lead to behavioral problems like feather pecking and piling. Cage enrichments help prevent these behavioral problems.\n\n## TRANSFER\n\nThe flock can be moved into the production facility at 15–17 weeks of age or after administration of the last live vaccines.\nMales may be moved a few days earlier to the production house to give them more time to acclimate to their new environment.\nIt is important that rearing and production breeder cages contain similar feed and water systems.\nAny sex slips should be removed around 7 weeks and at transfer.\nSupportive care to reduce stress such as water-soluble vitamins, probiotics and vitamin C should be used 3 days before and 3 days after transfer.\nLight intensity should increase weekly for 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house.\nLight hours of rearing and laying houses should be matched at transfer.\n\n## BREEDER HOUSE\n\nA breeder cage designed for a colony size of 90 birds will usually have better fertility than those with smaller colony size. Smaller breeder cages with 2 or 3 males are subject to accelerated fertility loss as the flock ages.\nBreeder laying cages should provide 750 cm² of floor space per bird (13 birds / m²).\nUse higher bird density in environmentally controlled houses and all-slat floors and lower density on litter floors and in hot climates.\nCage should have perching and nesting areas.\nFloor mesh size should be 2.54 cm x 2.54 cm.\nMale feeding area should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.\nCage height should be at least 48 cm in rear and 68 cm in production to avoid males hitting their heads on the top of the cage. Males striking their heads on the top of the cage will be reluctant to mate.\nMales in cage systems should be dubbed to avoid being caught in cage wires.\nIf mortality exceeds 0.1% / week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.\nRemove mortality daily.\n!\\[Image description\\](A diagram titled 'Colony Breeder Cage' illustrates the layout of a colony breeder cage with several sections labeled as 'Nesting area', 'Male feeding area', 'Automatic feeder' and 'Egg collection belt'.)\nBreeder cages should have a specific male feeder space. These spaces should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.\n\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Floor Systems Management\n\n## REARING PERIOD\n\nRear birds on the floor when they will be housed in floor systems during production.\nEquip rearing and production houses with similar feed and water systems.\nAccustom birds to humans by frequently walking through the house.\nWalk through birds briskly at 2 hour intervals.\nRearing house should have elevated bird walkways with feed and water stations.\nLight intensity should increase weekly for 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the layer house.\nBirds moving from light-controlled rearing houses into open-sided houses should have higher light intensities the last 2 weeks of rear.\nLight hours of rearing and production house should be matched at transfer.\n\n## TRANSFER\n\nThe flock can be moved into the production facility at 15–17 weeks of age or after administration of the last live vaccines.\nPlace females on slats when moving to the production house.\n\n## NEST TRAINING\n\nNest training is essential to minimize the number of out- of-nest eggs.\nStarting the day of arrival, open nest box curtains to encourage nest exploration.\nTrain females to use nests by frequent walks through house in the morning for the first 8 weeks after birds are moved to the production house.\nWhile walking, move birds away from resting areas, out of corners and toward nests.\nDuring the first week of production, leave a few eggs in the nest to encourage females to use nests.\nQuickly remove floor eggs.\nBe sure all floor eggs are removed before lights go out at night.\n\n## Nests\n\nNests should be dark, secluded, warm, and free of air drafts.\nEnsure there is sufficient nest space (6 birds per nest or 120 hens per m² in colony nests).\nMake sure nests are easy to access. Any obstructions should be removed. Feed lines should not be directly in front of nests.\nTurn nest lights on 1 hour before house lights are turned on to attract females. Turn nest lights off 1 hour after house lights come on.\nDiscontinue nest light usage after 26 weeks of age.\nFalse walls or partitions (perpendicular to nests and spaced every 5–7 m) may reduce overcrowding in nests.\nClose nests at night.\nEliminate dark areas in the house to discourage floor eggs.\nReplace worn nest floor mats.\n*A good nest floor mat*:\n\nProvides comfort for nesting female\nCushions egg to prevent damage\nKeeps egg clean\nSeparates dirt and feathers from egg surfaces\nAllows egg to roll easily to egg belt\n\n## HOUSE MANAGEMENT\n\nUse \\< 5 cm litter depth. Litter deeper than 5 cm results in increased floor eggs.\nFlocks housed in all-slat production houses should also be reared on slat or wire floors.\nUse of deterrent wires on slats around house perimeter will discourage egg laying in corners or near walls. Place deterrent wires 5 cm away from the wall of the house and 10 cm above the floor. (Check local regulations regarding the use of deterrent wires.)\nDeterrent wires should be activated as soon as birds are housed.\nSolid perches above water and feed lines are preferred.\nFeed and water lines should not block movement of females to nests.\nSchedule feed lines to run as soon as birds are awake and again after most eggs have been laid.\nIf mortality exceeds 0.1% / week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.\nRemove mortality daily.\nNests should have a staging area at the entrance to allow examination of the nests and easy access by females.\n\n## A Day in the Life of a Hy-Line W-36 Breeder Hen\n\n## All-Slat Breeder Houses\n\nDrawing not to scale.\n\nFeed and water lines should not block movement of females to nest (i.e. drinker lines too low, feeder lines too high).\n\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Perches\n\n• Enrich birds' environment and allow expression of normal behaviors\n• Allow birds to fully develop leg and breast muscles\n• Encourage jumping habits which increase bone strength and calcium content of bone and will be important in good nesting behavior\n• Reduce social stress by providing safe resting sites\n• Increase living space in house\n• Allow birds to roost at night\n• May reduce piling behavior in flocks\n\n## Perch Design\n\n• Place perches on slats to maintain good litter conditions.\n• Breeders should have access to perches by 3 weeks of age.\n• Provide 10–15 cm perch space per bird (check local regulations regarding perch space).\n• Separate perch rails by at least 30 cm to prevent cannibalistic pecking of birds on adjacent rails.\n• Avoid slippery perches.\n• Perches should be round or rectangular for better gripping and comfort.\n• Perches should support bottom of foot.\n• Place perches on slat to maintain good litter conditions and control floor eggs.\n• If possible, use the same perch style in rear and lay houses.\n• Don't use perches above water lines during rear if using deterrent over water line in production.\n• Perches should be easy to clean and disinfect between flocks.\n• Seal cracks, crevices and open ends of pipes to reduce hiding areas of red mites (Dermanyssus gallinae).\n\n## PERCH EXAMPLES\n\n\\-3.2 cm-\n\n## HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK\n\n| BIRD DENSITY (birds / m²) | AVAILABLE PERCH SPACE PER BIRD (cm) |\n| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| 7 | 4 |\n| 8 | 6 |\n| 9 | 8 |\n| 10 | 12 |\n| 11 | 13 |\n| 12 | 14 |\n\n## Perch Dimensions\n\n40 cm 45° Wall perch Perch over feeder A-frame perch with slats A-frame perch Elevated platform\n\n## Good Lighting Practices\n\nIn cage housing, measure minimum light intensity at feeder on bottom tier cages, mid-way between lights.\nIn floor housing, measure minimum light intensity at level of bird's head.\nKeep light bulbs and bulb covers clean to prevent loss of light intensity.\nPrevent dark areas caused by too much distance between lights or burned out light bulbs.\nShiny or white surfaces reflect light and increase light intensity.\nTake local conditions into account which may require adaptations of lighting programs.\nLight hours of rearing and production houses should be matched at transfer.\nLight intensity should increase 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house (but not prior to 14 weeks of age). Final rearing house light intensity should match the laying house intensity.\nLight stimulation period should extend into the peaking period (achieve 16 hours of light at approximately 25 weeks).\n\n## Light Program for Light-Controlled Housing (www.hyline.com)\n\nHy-Line W-36 breeders require a slower step-down of light hours from 0–11 weeks to prevent early sexual maturity and promote good body weight uniformity.\n\n| TIME OF DAY | HOURS OF LIGHT | |\n| ----------- | -------------- | - |\n| 24 | | 24 |\n| 23 | Gradual light increases up to 25 weeks of age, 16 hour maximum | 23 |\n| 22 | | 22 |\n| 21 | | 21 |\n| 20 | | 20 |\n| 19 | | 19 |\n| 18 | | 18 |\n| 17 | | 17 |\n| 16 | | 16 |\n| 15 | | 15 |\n| 14 | | 14 |\n| 13 | | 13 |\n| 12 | 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 12 12½ 13 13½ 14 14½ 15 15½ 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 | 12 |\n| 11 | | 11 |\n| 10 | | 10 |\n| 9 | | 9 |\n| 8 | | 8 |\n| 7 | | 7 |\n| 6 | | 6 |\n| 5 | | 5 |\n| 4 | | 4 |\n| 3 | | 3 |\n| 2 | | 2 |\n| 1 | Transfer flock to laying house | Light stimulation at ideal body weight (1220 kg) and 85% uniformity |\n| 0 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 | 0 |\n\nWEEKS OF AGE\n\n| LIGHT INTENSITY AND SPECTRUM | | | |\n| ---------------------------- | - | - | - |\n| 30-50 lux | 25 lux | 10 lux blue-green (\\>3500 K) | 20 lux AT ALL ST.

Houses that are not light controlled should use lighting programs for open-sided housing.\nAn intermittent lighting program for chicks is preferred. If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0-7 days, then use 22 hours of light from 0-3 days and 21 hours of light from 4-7 days.\n\"Lights on\" time can be varied between houses in laying flocks to facilitate egg collection on multiple flock complexes.\nIf the laying flock has a large spread in hatch ages and/or poor uniformity, light stimulate the flock based on the youngest hatch date or lightest birds.\nUse warm lights (2700-3500 K) in laying flocks to ensure sufficient red spectrum light.\nFor more information on poultry lighting, see the \"Understanding Poultry Lighting\" and \"Impact of Tarp Color on Poultry Lighting\" technical updates at www.hyline.com.\n\n## Customized Lighting Programs for Open-Sided Housing (www.hyline.com)\n\nThe Hy-Line International Lighting Program can create custom lighting programs for your location.

Allow 1 additional hour of incubation for every day beyond 10 days of egg age.\n\n• Chick weight at hatch is directly related to the weight of the hatching egg, usually approximately 66% of egg weight.\n\n• Eggs should be grouped in setter according to parent source flock. Maintain these groups so similar size chicks may be placed together in the brooder house.\n\n## Feather Sexing\n\nHY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK Hy-Line W-36 commercial chicks are sexable by their wing feathers. The female commercial chicks show fast feathering (primary wing feathers are longer and thicker than the covert feathers) and male commercial chicks are slow feathering (primary and covert feathers are the same length and thickness). In a small percentage of male chicks covert feathers may be longer than the primary feathers (super slow feathering).\n\nGoal: Sexing errors less than 0.5% The tip of the wing is used for feather sexing\n\n| Primaries | Coverts | Primaries | Coverts | Coverts | Primaries |\n| --------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |\n| Fast feathering = female chick Sight: Coverts are shorter than primaries Feel: Coverts are thin and primaries are thick | Slow feathering = male chick Sight: Coverts and primaries are short and same height Feel: Coverts and primaries same thickness | | Super slow feathering = male chick Sight: Coverts are longer than primary feathers Feel: Coverts and primaries same thickness Occurs in a small number of chicks | | |\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of a left wing, top side)\n\n## HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK\n\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Phase Feeding to Meet the Hen's Nutritional Needs\n\n| FEEDING PHASE¹ Change diet at (a body weight of) or (a production level of) | STARTER 1 (175 g) | STARTER 2 (400 g) | GROWER (860 g) | DEVELOPER (1100 g) | PRE-LAY (1200 g) | PEAKING (First egg until production drops 2% below peak) | BREEDER 2 (2% below peak to 90%) | BREEDER 3 (89-85%) | BREEDER 4 (84-80%) | BREEDER 5 (Less than 80%) |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------- |\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A chart showing the relationship between hen-day egg production, average egg weight, and body weight over weeks of age.)\n| HOUSE TEMPERATURE: Use temperature to control feed consumption and egg size |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Brooding | 18-20°C Only change 1º every 2 weeks |\n| | 20-25°C Only change 1º every 2 weeks |\n\n| FEED FORM: |\n| ---------- |\n| Crumble\\* | Mash |\n\n## Controlling Egg Weight\n\n* Monitor egg weight weekly throughout the life of the flock. \\* Egg-weight control is achieved by limiting amino acid and energy consumption. \\* Start controlling egg weight when the average egg weight is within 2 g of the target. \\* Excessively large hatching eggs are associated with lower hatchability and chick numbers.\n\n## Control of Ambient House Temperature\n\n* At housing, an ambient temperature of 18-20°C is desired. Increase house temperature about 1°C every 2 weeks until reaching 25°C, assuming ventilation systems are able to maintain adequate air quality at these temperatures. \\* Lower (colder) house temperatures will lead to greater feed intakes and may be counterproductive to egg-weight control, as well as optimal feed efficiency and adult hen body weights.\n\n## Rearing Period Nutritional Recommendations\n\n| CHANGE DIET AT A BODY WEIGHT OF | STARTER 1 171–179 g | STARTER 2 393–407 g | GROWER 847–873 g | DEVELOPER 1083–1117 g | PRE-LAY¹ 1180–1220 g |\n| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | 120 |\n| | | | | | 105 |\n| | | | | Body weight (g) | 90 |\n| | | | | | 75 |\n| | | | | | 60 |\n| | | | | Feed consumption (g / day per bird) | 45 |\n| | | | | | 30 |\n| | | | | | 15 |\n| WEEKS OF AGE | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 0 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n| NUTRITION | RECOMMENDED NUTRIENT CONCENTRATION |\n| --------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| Metabolizable energy², kcal/kg | 3020-3110 3000-3085 2975-3065 2975-3065 2910-2955 |\n| Metabolizable energy², MJ/kg | 12.65-13.00 12.55-12.90 12.45-12.85 12.45-12.85 12.20-12.35 |\n| | Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids / Total Amino Acids³ |\n| Lysine, % | 1.03 / 1.13 0.85 / 0.93 0.77 / 0.84 0.73 / 0.80 0.86 / 0.94 |\n| Methionine, % | 0.43 / 0.47 0.38 / 0.41 0.35 / 0.38 0.34 / 0.37 0.40 / 0.43 |\n| Methionine+Cystine, % | 0.68 / 0.77 0.64 / 0.72 0.59 / 0.66 0.58 / 0.65 0.71 / 0.80 |\n| Threonine, % | 0.67 / 0.79 0.56 / 0.66 0.52 / 0.61 0.50 / 0.58 0.60 / 0.71 |\n| Tryptophan, % | 0.18 / 0.21 0.14 / 0.17 0.14 / 0.17 0.14 / 0.17 0.17 / 0.21 |\n| Arginine, % | 1.11 / 1.20 0.92 / 0.99 0.83 / 0.89 0.79 / 0.85 0.93 / 1.00 |\n| Isoleucine, % | 0.72 / 0.78 0.61 / 0.66 0.57 / 0.61 0.55 / 0.59 0.69 / 0.74 |\n| Valine, % | 0.74 / 0.82 0.63 / 0.69 0.60 / 0.66 0.58 / 0.64 0.73 / 0.81 |\n| Crude protein, % | 20.00 18.00 16.00 15.50 17.50 |\n| Calcium³, % | 1.10 1.10 1.10 1.10 2.75 |\n| Phosphorus (available)6, % | 0.50 0.49 0.47 0.46 0.50 |\n| Sodium, % | 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.18 |\n| Chloride, % | 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.18 |\n| Linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6)7, % | 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 |\n\n'Do not feed Pre-Lay Diet earlier than 15 weeks of age. Do not feed Pre-Lay later than first egg as it contains insufficient calcium to support egg production. Implementing a pre-lay diet can be challenging in mixed-age flocks. If it's not possible to use the Pre- Lay diet, the calcium content of the last stage rearing diet (developer) must be increased to 1.4%. ² Recommended energy range is based on raw material energy values shown in feed ingredient table at back of this guide. It is important that target concentrations of dietary energy are adjusted according to energy system applied to raw material matrix. ³ Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed. ⁴ Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only. ⁵ Calcium should be supplied as fine calcium carbonate (mean particle size less than 2 mm). Coarse limestone (2-4 mm) can be introduced in Pre-Lay Diet at up to 50% of total limestone. \\* Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus. ⁷ Oil levels can be increased to 2.0% in starter diets when given as a mash to control dust and increase feed palatability.\n\nHY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK \\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Transition Period from Rear to Peak Egg Production\n\nFrequently formulate to changing feed consumption during transition period until feed consumption is consistent.\n\n| WEEKS OF AGE | | |\n| ------------ | - | - |\n| 105 / 2000 | | 100 |\n| 100 / 1900 | Hen-day egg production (%) | 90 |\n| 95 / 1800 | Feed consumption (g / day per bird) | 80 |\n| 90 / 1700 | | 70 |\n| 85 / 1600 | Egg weight (g) | 60 |\n| 80 / 1500 | | 50 |\n| 75 / 1400 | Body weight (g) | 40 |\n| 70 / 1300 | | 30 |\n| 65 / 1200 | | 20 |\n| 60 / 1100 | | 10 |\n| 55 / 1000 | | 0 |\n| 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 | | | HEN-DAY EGG PRODUCTION (%) EGG WEIGHT (g) |\n\n## Pre-Lay Ration\n\n* Plan to feed for a maximum of 10–14 days before point of lay.\n\n* Feed when most pullets show reddening of combs.\n\n* It is important to increase medullary bone reserves.\n\n* Begin introducing large particle calcium in Pre-Lay Diet.\n\n* Discontinue pre-lay feeding with the commencement of egg production.\n\n## Transition Period\n\n* Occurring during the transition period: – Rapidly increasing egg production – Increasing egg size – Increasing body weight \\* Feed consumption may increase slowly during transition: – In underweight birds – In flocks lacking uniformity – During high environmental temperatures \\* Poor uniformity prolongs the transition period and may result in low peak and poor persistency of egg production.\n\n* Monitor feed intake carefully during transition and adjust dietary nutrient concentration according to actual feed intakes.\n\n## Peaking Ration\n\n* Formulations for low feed intakes (77–88 g/ day per bird) should be given as the flock enters egg production to better meet nutrient requirements.\n\n* Begin Peaking Diet with onset of lay (1% egg production).\n\n* Ensure that Peaking Diet is in the feeders when first eggs are laid, not in the feed bin.\n\n* Birds should continue to grow during peaking period. Poor nutrition during this period can lead to loss of body weight and soft bones.\n\n* Feed intake may be reduced if birds are not accustomed to extra large particle calcium (i.e. not using a Pre-Lay Diet).\n\n* Monitor keel bone development during the peaking period. For more information on keel bone scoring, see the \"Understanding the Role of the Skeleton in Egg Production\" technical update at www.hyline.com.\n\n* Hy-Line W-36 breeders require early egg weight control through nutrition; egg weight can increase rapidly if uncontrolled.\n\n## Production Period Nutritional Recommendations 1,2\n\n| FEEDING PHASEPRODUCTION | PEAKING³First egg until productiondrops 2% below peak | BREEDER 22% belowpeak to 90% | BREEDER 389-85% | BREEDER 484-80% | BREEDER 5Less than 80% |\n| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Graph depicting Hen-day egg production (%) and Egg weight (g) over weeks of age from 18 to 75.

Prior to achieving peak egg production, the nutrient requirements will be lower. ⁴ A good approximation of the influence of temperature on energy needs is that for each 0.5°C change higher or lower than 22°C, subtract or add about 1.8 kcal/bird/day, respectively. ⁵ Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized lleal Digestible AminoAcids must be followed. ⁶ Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is anestimated typical value only. ⁷ Calcium and available phosphorus requirements are determined by flock age. When production remains higher and diets are fed for longer than ages shown, it is recommended to increaseto calcium and phosphorus concentrations of next feeding phase. ⁸ Calcium carbonate particle size recommendation varies throughout lay. Refer to Calcium Particle Size Table. Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility. ⁹ Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.\n\n## Dietary Nutrient Concentrations for Production Period1,2 (According to Phase and Feed Intake)\n\n| FEEDING PHASE | PEAKING³ First egg until production drops 2% below peak | BREEDER 2 2% below peak to 85% | BREEDER 3 84-80% | BREEDER 4 Less than 80% | NUTRITION | RECOMMENDED CONCENTRATION | Metabolizable energy, kcal/kg | | 2822-2910 | 2822-2910 | 2822-2910 | 2822-2910 | Metabolizable energy, MJ/kg | | 11.84-12.21 | 11.84-12.21 | 11.84-12.21 | 11.84-12.21 | FEED CONSUMPTION (\\*Typical Feed Consumption) | g/day per bird | 85 | 90 | 95 | 100 | 105 | 85 | 90 | 95 | 100 | 105 | 110 | 95 | 100 | 105 | 110 | 115 | 88 | 93 | 98\\* | 103 | 108 |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -

Good quality water must be available to birds at all times. • Water and feed consumption are directly related—when birds drink less, they consume less feed and production quickly declines. • As a general rule, healthy birds will consume 1.5-2.0 times more water than feed. This ratio increases in high ambient temperatures. • Test water quality at least 1 time per year. The water source will determine the regularity of water testing. Surface water requires more frequent testing, as it is more affected by season and rainfall patterns. Closed wells taking water from aquifers or deep artesian basins will be more consistent in water quality, but are generally higher in dissolved mineral content. • The presence of coliform bacteria is an indicator that the water source has been contaminated with animal or human waste.\n\n## HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK\n\n• When collecting a well water sample, let the water run for 2 minutes prior to collecting the sample. Water samples should be kept below 10°C and submitted to the lab in less than 24 hours. Some water sources contain high levels of dissolved minerals such as calcium, sodium and magnesium. When this occurs, amounts of these minerals in water have to be considered when formulating feed. • Ideal water pH is 5-7 to promote good water sanitation, increase feed consumption and improve upper gastrointestinal health. • Less than optimum water quality can have a significant impact on intestinal health, which will lead to under utilization of nutrients in feed. • Reduced flock water consumption is often the first sign of health problems and production drops.\n\n| ITEM | MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION (ppm or mg/L)\\* | |\n| ---- | ------------------------------------ | - |\n| Nitrate NO3- 1 | 25 | Older birds will tolerate higher levels up to 20 ppm.

Avian Advice 10(3): 10-15 University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service, Fayetteville\n\n## Disease Control\n\nA flock of pullets or layers can only perform up to its genetic potential when disease influence is minimized. The diseases of economic importance vary widely between locations, but in every case the challenge is to identify and control those diseases.\n\n## Biosecurity\n\nBiosecurity is the best method of avoiding diseases. A good biosecurity program identifies and controls the most likely ways a disease could enter the farm.\n\nHuman and equipment movement onto the farm should be strictly controlled.\nVisitors to the farm should be limited to those essential for its operation.\nVisits should be documented in a logbook.\nAll visitors and workers should shower at a central location before entering.\nClean boots, clothing and head cover should be provided for workers and visitors.\n\nClean footbaths containing disinfectant should be placed outside entries to all poultry houses.\nIf possible, avoid using outside crews or equipment for vaccination, moving, and beak trimming.\nIdeally, workers should be limited to a single house.\nFor those visiting a number of flocks, flocks visited on one day should be limited. Always progress from younger to older and from healthy to sick flocks. After visiting a sick flock, no other houses should be entered.\nRemoval of flocks from the farm is an opportunity for disease to be introduced, as trucks and crews have often been on other farms.\nA single-aged rearing farm using an all-in, all-out principle is best to prevent transmission of disease from older flocks to younger, susceptible flocks.\nHouses should be designed to prevent exposure to wild birds, insects and rodents.\nQuickly and properly dispose of dead chickens.\n\n## Rodents\n\nRodents are known carriers of many poultry diseases and the most common reason for re-contamination of a cleaned and disinfected poultry facility. They are also responsible for house-to-house spread of disease on a farm.\n\nThe farm should be free of debris and tall grass that provide a hiding area for rodents.\nThe perimeter of each house should have a 1 m wide area of crushed rock or concrete to prevent rodents from burrowing into the house.\nFeed and eggs should be stored in rodent-proof areas.\nBait stations should be placed throughout the house and maintained with fresh rodenticide.\n\n## Cleaning and Disinfection\n\nCleaning and disinfection of the house between flocks reduces infection pressure for the next flock.\n\nAllow a minimum of 2 weeks downtime between flocks.\nAll feed and manure should be removed from the house before cleaning.\nThoroughly clean air inlets, fan housing, fan blades and fan louvers.\nHeating the house during washing improves the removal of organic matter.\nThe house should be cleaned of organic matter with a high-pressure spray of warm water.\nUse foam / gel detergent to soak into organic matter and equipment.\nWash the upper portion of the house before the pit.\nUse high pressure warm water to rinse.\nAllow the house to dry.\nAfter it is fully dry, apply foam / spray disinfectant followed by fumigation.\nFlush and sanitize water lines.\nMonitoring of poultry houses for presence of *Salmonella*, particularly *Salmonella enteritidis*, by routine environmental testing is recommended.\nAllow the house to dry before repopulating.\n\n## Vertically Transmitted Diseases\n\nSome diseases are known to be transmitted from infected breeders to progeny.\n\nDisease-free breeders are the first step in control of these diseases for commercial layers.\nAll breeders directly under Hy-Line International's control are free of lymphoid leukosis, *Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, Salmonella pullorum, Salmonella gallinarum, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium* and other *Salmonella* species.\nDue to the possibility of horizontal transmission of these diseases, later generations may not remain free.\nIt is the responsibility of breeding and commercial flock owners to prevent horizontal transmission of these diseases and to continue testing to be assured of a negative status.\n!\\[Image description\\](Hy Line. STOP\nLAYERS\nDO NOT ENTER\nTHIS IS A BIOSECURE AREA)\n\n## COCCIDIA\n\nThis parasitic infection of the intestines may lead to gut damage and, in severe infestations, death. More commonly, poor control of sub-clinical infection reduces feed conversion or leaves pullets with chronic, irreversible gut damage. Pullet flocks may be uneven or underweight at housing and not perform to their full potential in lay. Control of coccidia includes the following measures (check local regulations):\n\nUse ionophores or chemicals on a step-down program to ensure immunity in pullets.\nLive vaccine use is an alternative to anti-coccidial drug treatments.\nLive vaccines are available that can be administered by spray in the hatchery or by feed or water application during the first few days in the brooder house.\nControl of flies and beetles, which are vectors of coccidial spread.\nThorough cleaning and disinfection of houses reduces challenge pressure.\nMaintenance of dry litter reduces coccidia oocyst sporulation.\n\n## Vaccination Recommendations\n\n## Vaccination\n\nCertain diseases are too widespread or difficult to eradicate and require a routine vaccination program. In general, all layer flocks should be vaccinated against Marek's disease, Newcastle disease (NDV), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD or Gumboro), chicken anemia virus (CAV), avian encephalomyelitis (AE) and fowl pox.

    "## Drinking Systems\n\nDrinking water should be tested for quality and cleanliness from source and end of the water line.\nFlush water lines weekly during the brooding period, starting the day prior to chick arrival. Flush water lines weekly during rearing and production periods.\nDo not give cold water to chicks. Be careful when flushing water lines for chicks. Allow water time to warm up in the house so chicks are comfortable drinking.\nFlush chick water lines at night to allow water to warm in water lines.\nMaintain water temperature of 20–25°C during brooding period.\nNipple drinkers should deliver minimum 60 ml per minute/nipple, with easy activation of the drinkers by chicks.\nUse the same drinker type in rearing and laying houses.\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of cup and nipple drinkers for chicks, illustrating their use and level relative to the chick.)\nCup drinkers should be manually filled during 0–3 days to train chicks to drink.\nOpen drinkers (bell, plasson, supplemental chick drinkers, trough) are easily contaminated and should be cleaned daily.\nAdjust nipple water system pressure to create hanging drop to help chicks find water for up to 3 days.\nSplash cups are useful during brooding period and in hot climates.\n360° activated nipples make drinking easy for chicks.\nUse only 360° activated nipples for hatchery beak- treated chicks, as well as supplemental chick drinkers.\n\n## Beak Treatment / Trimming *(Check local regulations concerning use of beak trimming)*\n\nHy-Line W-36 parent female is most successfully beak trimmed at hatch by infrared beak treatment or between 7-10 days\nof age by precision beak trimming.\nHy-Line W-36 male should preferably not be beak trimmed. If treatment is required, beak treat in hatchery or tip at 7-10\ndays of age.\nFemales should be re-trimmed at 6 weeks or 12-14 weeks of age.\nHatchery beak treatment or 7-10-day beak trimming reduces feed wastage and leaves the beak less damaging to other birds.\n",

    "## Precautions when using IRBT or beak trimming birds:\n\nWater intake is the most important factor in the success of\nIRBT/beak trimming. Chicks require immediate and easy access\nto water.\nDo not beak-trim sick or stressed birds.\nDo not hurry; handle chicks carefully.\nProvide vitamins and electrolytes containing vitamin K in\ndrinking water 2 days before and 2 days after beak trimming.\nWatch chicks after beak trimming to assess stress. Raise\nambient temperature until birds appear comfortable and active.\nKeep feed at the highest level for several days after beak\ntrimming.\nUse only well-trained crews.\nUse 360° activated nipples.\nNipple drinkers with splash cups provide additional support\nfor IRBT chicks.\nProvide extra light on nipple drinkers after beak treatment.\n\n# Growth and Development\n\nFocus on pullet rearing programs to optimize growth and development.\nThe best predictor of future laying performance is the pullet's body weight and body type at the point of lay.\nThe design of the rearing facility should closely match that of the layer house to which the flock will be transferred. Drinker and feeder type and perching should match. This makes the transition of the birds from rearing to laying easy and stress-free.\nA pullet flock entering into egg production at correct body weight (females 1.18-1.22 kg) with uniformity higher than 90% performs best in the production period.\nIt is important to achieve 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 week body weight targets to ensure optimum development of the bird's body.\nIf possible, exceed pullet body weight standards throughout rear.\nUse a crumble starter feed to promote good feed intake.\nChange rearing diets only when recommended body weights are attained.\nAnticipate rapid rise in ambient temperature and adjust bird's diet accordingly. Birds will eat less when exposed to a rapid temperature increase. (See the \"Understanding Heat Stress in Layers\" technical update at www.hyline.com.)\nStress periods require change in diet formulation to ensure proper nutrient intake.\nBy 12 weeks of age, match the feeding schedule to be used in the layer house.\n",
    "During the rearing period, run feeders 3-5 times per day. Feed more frequently to encourage feed intake in underweight flocks or in hot weather.\nManage feeders so that additional feedings do not create excessive fine feed particles.

    "## Hy-Line W-36 Male Management\n\nThe W-36 male chick is smaller than the female and will benefit from a 1°C warmer brooding temperature.\nThe W-36 male's 18-week body weight is 1.54–1.58 kg.\nThe W-36 male's adult body weight is 1.95–1.99 kg (40 weeks of age).\nThe W-36 male should be infrared beak treated at the hatchery or tipped at 7-10 days of age.\nAchieving male target body weights during rear is critical for optimum mating behavior and fertility.\nMales and females should receive the same feed and lighting schedule.\nFor breeder cages having a specific male feeder space, these spaces should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.\nMale and female breeders should reach sexual maturity at approximately the same time.\nFrom 0-4 weeks, rear males separately to improve male body weight gain.\nAt 5 weeks, mix males and females. In cages, mix 3–4 females into each male cage. If males appear weaker than females, mix males with females at a 1:1 ratio through the rearing period.\nGrading males into pens based on body weight can improve male uniformity.\nMales and females must be co-mingled during rearing period to become socialized and avoid mating problems as adults.\nKeep extra males in a separate pen; do not mix extra males with females.\nContinue culling males as needed during production.\nMaintain a mating ratio of 10 males for every 100 females throughout production in floor and cage systems.\nToo many males results in more fighting, less mating activity and disruption of social groups and lower fertility.\n!\\[Image description\\](Red vent from a mating\nW-36 male.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Vent from non-mating\nrooster.)\n",

Breeders handled in this way may experience displaced pecking behavior and poor nesting behaviors as adults.*\n\n## Breeder Cage Enrichment\n\nEnriched cages address some of the welfare concerns of layers in cages by providing more space with environment enrichment devices, such as perches, nest boxes, scratch areas and abrasive pads for beak and toe shortening.\nAs group size increases, there is more competition for feed and water space and less stable social groups. This could lead to behavioral problems like feather pecking and piling. Cage enrichments help prevent these behavioral problems.\n",
    "## TRANSFER\n\nThe flock can be moved into the production facility at 15–17 weeks of age or after administration of the last live vaccines.\nMales may be moved a few days earlier to the production house to give them more time to acclimate to their new environment.\nIt is important that rearing and production breeder cages contain similar feed and water systems.\nAny sex slips should be removed around 7 weeks and at transfer.\nSupportive care to reduce stress such as water-soluble vitamins, probiotics and vitamin C should be used 3 days before and 3 days after transfer.\nLight intensity should increase weekly for 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house.\nLight hours of rearing and laying houses should be matched at transfer.\n",
    "## BREEDER HOUSE\n\nA breeder cage designed for a colony size of 90 birds will usually have better fertility than those with smaller colony size. Smaller breeder cages with 2 or 3 males are subject to accelerated fertility loss as the flock ages.\nBreeder laying cages should provide 750 cm² of floor space per bird (13 birds / m²).\nUse higher bird density in environmentally controlled houses and all-slat floors and lower density on litter floors and in hot climates.\nCage should have perching and nesting areas.\nFloor mesh size should be 2.54 cm x 2.54 cm.\nMale feeding area should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.\nCage height should be at least 48 cm in rear and 68 cm in production to avoid males hitting their heads on the top of the cage. Males striking their heads on the top of the cage will be reluctant to mate.\nMales in cage systems should be dubbed to avoid being caught in cage wires.\nIf mortality exceeds 0.1% / week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.\nRemove mortality daily.\n!\\[Image description\\](A diagram titled 'Colony Breeder Cage' illustrates the layout of a colony breeder cage with several sections labeled as 'Nesting area', 'Male feeding area', 'Automatic feeder' and 'Egg collection belt'.)\nBreeder cages should have a specific male feeder space.

    "## TRANSFER\n\nThe flock can be moved into the production facility at 15–17 weeks of age or after administration of the last live vaccines.\nPlace females on slats when moving to the production house.\n\n## NEST TRAINING\n\nNest training is essential to minimize the number of out- of-nest eggs.\nStarting the day of arrival, open nest box curtains to encourage nest exploration.\nTrain females to use nests by frequent walks through house in the morning for the first 8 weeks after birds are moved to the production house.\nWhile walking, move birds away from resting areas, out of corners and toward nests.\nDuring the first week of production, leave a few eggs in the nest to encourage females to use nests.\nQuickly remove floor eggs.\nBe sure all floor eggs are removed before lights go out at night.\n\n## Nests\n\nNests should be dark, secluded, warm, and free of air drafts.\nEnsure there is sufficient nest space (6 birds per nest or 120 hens per m² in colony nests).\nMake sure nests are easy to access. Any obstructions should be removed. Feed lines should not be directly in front of nests.\nTurn nest lights on 1 hour before house lights are turned on to attract females. Turn nest lights off 1 hour after house lights come on.\nDiscontinue nest light usage after 26 weeks of age.\nFalse walls or partitions (perpendicular to nests and spaced every 5–7 m) may reduce overcrowding in nests.\nClose nests at night.\nEliminate dark areas in the house to discourage floor eggs.\nReplace worn nest floor mats.\n*A good nest floor mat*:\n\nProvides comfort for nesting female\nCushions egg to prevent damage\nKeeps egg clean\nSeparates dirt and feathers from egg surfaces\nAllows egg to roll easily to egg belt\n",
    "## HOUSE MANAGEMENT\n\nUse \\< 5 cm litter depth. Litter deeper than 5 cm results in increased floor eggs.\nFlocks housed in all-slat production houses should also be reared on slat or wire floors.\nUse of deterrent wires on slats around house perimeter will discourage egg laying in corners or near walls. Place deterrent wires 5 cm away from the wall of the house and 10 cm above the floor. (Check local regulations regarding the use of deterrent wires.)\nDeterrent wires should be activated as soon as birds are housed.\nSolid perches above water and feed lines are preferred.\nFeed and water lines should not block movement of females to nests.\nSchedule feed lines to run as soon as birds are awake and again after most eggs have been laid.\nIf mortality exceeds 0.1% / week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.\nRemove mortality daily.\nNests should have a staging area at the entrance to allow examination of the nests and easy access by females.\n\n# A Day in the Life of a Hy-Line W-36 Breeder Hen\n\n## All-Slat Breeder Houses\n\nDrawing not to scale.\n\nFeed and water lines should not block movement of females to nest (i.e. drinker lines too low, feeder lines too high).\n\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Perches\n\n• Enrich birds' environment and allow expression of normal behaviors\n• Allow birds to fully develop leg and breast muscles\n• Encourage jumping habits which increase bone strength and calcium content of bone and will be important in good nesting behavior\n• Reduce social stress by providing safe resting sites\n• Increase living space in house\n• Allow birds to roost at night\n• May reduce piling behavior in flocks\n",
    "## Perch Design\n\n• Place perches on slats to maintain good litter conditions.\n• Breeders should have access to perches by 3 weeks of age.\n• Provide 10–15 cm perch space per bird (check local regulations regarding perch space).\n• Separate perch rails by at least 30 cm to prevent cannibalistic pecking of birds on adjacent rails.\n• Avoid slippery perches.\n• Perches should be round or rectangular for better gripping and comfort.\n• Perches should support bottom of foot.\n• Place perches on slat to maintain good litter conditions and control floor eggs.\n• If possible, use the same perch style in rear and lay houses.\n• Don't use perches above water lines during rear if using deterrent over water line in production.\n• Perches should be easy to clean and disinfect between flocks.\n• Seal cracks, crevices and open ends of pipes to reduce hiding areas of red mites (Dermanyssus gallinae).\n\n## PERCH EXAMPLES\n\n\\-3.2 cm-\n\n## HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK\n\n| BIRD DENSITY (birds / m²) | AVAILABLE PERCH SPACE PER BIRD (cm) |\n| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| 7 | 4 |\n| 8 | 6 |\n| 9 | 8 |\n| 10 | 12 |\n| 11 | 13 |\n| 12 | 14 |\n\n## Perch Dimensions\n\n40 cm 45° Wall perch Perch over feeder A-frame perch with slats A-frame perch Elevated platform\n",
    "## Good Lighting Practices\n\nIn cage housing, measure minimum light intensity at feeder on bottom tier cages, mid-way between lights.\nIn floor housing, measure minimum light intensity at level of bird's head.\nKeep light bulbs and bulb covers clean to prevent loss of light intensity.\nPrevent dark areas caused by too much distance between lights or burned out light bulbs.\nShiny or white surfaces reflect light and increase light intensity.\nTake local conditions into account which may require adaptations of lighting programs.\nLight hours of rearing and production houses should be matched at transfer.\nLight intensity should increase 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house (but not prior to 14 weeks of age). Final rearing house light intensity should match the laying house intensity.\nLight stimulation period should extend into the peaking period (achieve 16 hours of light at approximately 25 weeks).\n",

  AT ALL ST. AND MORE SPECIFICALLY WITHIN POULTRY NUTRITION.  |\n\nLight-controlled houses are those which use light traps around fans and air inlets and complete prevent the ingress of light from the outside. Houses that are not light controlled should use lighting programs for open-sided housing.\nAn intermittent lighting program for chicks is preferred. If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0-7 days, then use 22 hours of light from 0-3 days and 21 hours of light from 4-7 days.\n",
    "\"Lights on\" time can be varied between houses in laying flocks to facilitate egg collection on multiple flock complexes.\nIf the laying flock has a large spread in hatch ages and/or poor uniformity, light stimulate the flock based on the youngest hatch date or lightest birds.\nUse warm lights (2700-3500 K) in laying flocks to ensure sufficient red spectrum light.\nFor more information on poultry lighting, see the \"Understanding Poultry Lighting\" and \"Impact of Tarp Color on Poultry Lighting\" technical updates at www.hyline.com.\n\n# Customized Lighting Programs for Open-Sided Housing (www.hyline.com)\n\nThe Hy-Line International Lighting Program can create custom lighting programs for your location. To prevent early sexual development, the program finds the longest natural day length between 12-17 weeks of age and constructs an artificial lighting program that holds day length constant with artificial lights from 12-17 weeks.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Screenshot of a lighting program setup form with various input fields for location, hatch date, lighting standards, housing style, and email options.)\nOn the first screen—enter *e-mail* address and select language.\nOn the second screen, use dropdowns for \"Select Location of Flock\" \"Hatch Date\" \"Variety Standards\" and \"Housing Style.\"\nClick on \"Create Lighting Spreadsheet.\"\nResults will be *e-mailed* to you.\n",

This program may need to be further adapted to better fit local conditions. Please email info@hyline.com for further questions or technical assistance.\n\n## HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK\n\n## Lighting Considerations\n\n## FLOOR\n\nLight intensity in house should be brightest over feeding and resting areas and gradually decrease toward nests.\nAvoid dark areas near feeding and resting areas to prevent floor eggs.\n!\\[Image description\\](Illustration of poultry house with lights above resting areas. Labels indicate litter/scratch areas and slats.)\n\n## CAGES\n\nAlternating the height of lights improves light distribution to all cage levels.\nPosition lights to minimize bright and dark areas in the house.\n!\\[Image description\\](Illustration of poultry cage with lights above each cage level.)\n",
    "## Use of Shades in Open-Sided Housing\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Two photographs of poultry houses with shades.)\nShades are an effective way to decrease light intensity in an open-sided house.\nKeep shades clean and free of dust to allow air flow.\nUse stir fans when using shades.\nAvoid direct sunlight on birds by using shades or roof overhangs.\nBlack shades are preferred.\n\\<\\<

Lighting Program\n\nOptional lighting technique that promotes greater feed consumption\nUsed whenever more feed intake is desired in rearing or laying flocks\nIncreases calcium absorption during night when most egg shell is formed\nUseful to increase feed intake during peak egg production\nHelps maintain feed consumption in hot climates\nMidnight feeding may increase feed intake 2-5 g / day per bird\n",
    "## Good Practices\n\nInitiate the program by turning lights on for 1-2 hours in the middle of the dark period.\nThere must be at least 3 hours of dark before and after the midnight feeding.\nFill feeders before lights are turned on.\nLight provided during the midnight feeding is in addition to regular day length (i.e. 16 hours + midnight feeding).\nIf midnight feeding is removed, reduce light gradually at a rate of 15 minutes per week.\n\n# HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK\n\n## Management Events for Breeders\n",

    "## Water Quality\n\n• Water is the most important nutrient. Good quality water must be available to birds at all times. • Water and feed consumption are directly related—when birds drink less, they consume less feed and production quickly declines. • As a general rule, healthy birds will consume 1.5-2.0 times more water than feed. This ratio increases in high ambient temperatures. • Test water quality at least 1 time per year. The water source will determine the regularity of water testing. Surface water requires more frequent testing, as it is more affected by season and rainfall patterns. Closed wells taking water from aquifers or deep artesian basins will be more consistent in water quality, but are generally higher in dissolved mineral content. • The presence of coliform bacteria is an indicator that the water source has been contaminated with animal or human waste.\n\n## HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK\n\n• When collecting a well water sample, let the water run for 2 minutes prior to collecting the sample. Water samples should be kept below 10°C and submitted to the lab in less than 24 hours. Some water sources contain high levels of dissolved minerals such as calcium, sodium and magnesium. When this occurs, amounts of these minerals in water have to be considered when formulating feed. • Ideal water pH is 5-7 to promote good water sanitation, increase feed consumption and improve upper gastrointestinal health. • Less than optimum water quality can have a significant impact on intestinal health, which will lead to under utilization of nutrients in feed. • Reduced flock water consumption is often the first sign of health problems and production drops.\n",

The diseases of economic importance vary widely between locations, but in every case the challenge is to identify and control those diseases.\n",
    "## Biosecurity\n\nBiosecurity is the best method of avoiding diseases. A good biosecurity program identifies and controls the most likely ways a disease could enter the farm.\n\nHuman and equipment movement onto the farm should be strictly controlled.\nVisitors to the farm should be limited to those essential for its operation.\nVisits should be documented in a logbook.\nAll visitors and workers should shower at a central location before entering.\nClean boots, clothing and head cover should be provided for workers and visitors.\n\nClean footbaths containing disinfectant should be placed outside entries to all poultry houses.\nIf possible, avoid using outside crews or equipment for vaccination, moving, and beak trimming.\nIdeally, workers should be limited to a single house.\nFor those visiting a number of flocks, flocks visited on one day should be limited. Always progress from younger to older and from healthy to sick flocks. After visiting a sick flock, no other houses should be entered.\nRemoval of flocks from the farm is an opportunity for disease to be introduced, as trucks and crews have often been on other farms.\nA single-aged rearing farm using an all-in, all-out principle is best to prevent transmission of disease from older flocks to younger, susceptible flocks.\nHouses should be designed to prevent exposure to wild birds, insects and rodents.\nQuickly and properly dispose of dead chickens.\n\n## Rodents\n\nRodents are known carriers of many poultry diseases and the most common reason for re-contamination of a cleaned and disinfected poultry facility. They are also responsible for house-to-house spread of disease on a farm.\n\nThe farm should be free of debris and tall grass that provide a hiding area for rodents.\nThe perimeter of each house should have a 1 m wide area of crushed rock or concrete to prevent rodents from burrowing into the house.\nFeed and eggs should be stored in rodent-proof areas.\nBait stations should be placed throughout the house and maintained with fresh rodenticide.\n",
    "## Cleaning and Disinfection\n\nCleaning and disinfection of the house between flocks reduces infection pressure for the next flock.\n\nAllow a minimum of 2 weeks downtime between flocks.\nAll feed and manure should be removed from the house before cleaning.\nThoroughly clean air inlets, fan housing, fan blades and fan louvers.\nHeating the house during washing improves the removal of organic matter.\nThe house should be cleaned of organic matter with a high-pressure spray of warm water.\nUse foam / gel detergent to soak into organic matter and equipment.\nWash the upper portion of the house before the pit.\nUse high pressure warm water to rinse.\nAllow the house to dry.\nAfter it is fully dry, apply foam / spray disinfectant followed by fumigation.\nFlush and sanitize water lines.\nMonitoring of poultry houses for presence of *Salmonella*, particularly *Salmonella enteritidis*, by routine environmental testing is recommended.\nAllow the house to dry before repopulating.\n\n## Vertically Transmitted Diseases\n\nSome diseases are known to be transmitted from infected breeders to progeny.\n\nDisease-free breeders are the first step in control of these diseases for commercial layers.\nAll breeders directly under Hy-Line International's control are free of lymphoid leukosis, *Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, Salmonella pullorum, Salmonella gallinarum, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium* and other *Salmonella* species.\nDue to the possibility of horizontal transmission of these diseases, later generations may not remain free.\nIt is the responsibility of breeding and commercial flock owners to prevent horizontal transmission of these diseases and to continue testing to be assured of a negative status.\n!\\[Image description\\](Hy Line.                                                                STOP\nLAYERS\nDO NOT ENTER\nTHIS IS A BIOSECURE AREA)\n",
    "## COCCIDIA\n\nThis parasitic infection of the intestines may lead to gut damage and, in severe infestations, death. More commonly, poor control of sub-clinical infection reduces feed conversion or leaves pullets with chronic, irreversible gut damage. Pullet flocks may be uneven or underweight at housing and not perform to their full potential in lay. Control of coccidia includes the following measures (check local regulations):\n\nUse ionophores or chemicals on a step-down program to ensure immunity in pullets.\nLive vaccine use is an alternative to anti-coccidial drug treatments.\nLive vaccines are available that can be administered by spray in the hatchery or by feed or water application during the first few days in the brooder house.\nControl of flies and beetles, which are vectors of coccidial spread.\nThorough cleaning and disinfection of houses reduces challenge pressure.\nMaintenance of dry litter reduces coccidia oocyst sporulation.\n\n# Vaccination Recommendations\n\n## Vaccination\n\nCertain diseases are too widespread or difficult to eradicate and require a routine vaccination program. In general, all layer flocks should be vaccinated against Marek's disease, Newcastle disease (NDV), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD or Gumboro), chicken anemia virus (CAV), avian encephalomyelitis (AE) and fowl pox. Other vaccinations are added to the program as local disease challenges dictate.\n\nA single program cannot be recommended for all regions. Follow label instructions provided by the vaccine manufacturer. Use only approved vaccines. Consult with local veterinarians to determine the best vaccination program for your area.\n\n## BASIC BREEDER VACCINE APPLICATIONS\n",
