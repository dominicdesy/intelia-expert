First, an external visual exam is conducted for any obvious outward signs indicating the cause of death. Next, an internal visual examination is conducted to obtain further diagnostic information. Samples can be collected and sent to a laboratory for diagnostic tests.\n\nConducting a post-mortem on a regular basis can help provide insightful information about incidental flock mortality, be a very useful assessment to provide feedback on poultry health programs, and be an important diagnostic tool when a disease is suspected in a flock. A good way to proceed is to do a post- mortem of all the mortality on a specific day and repeat this process on a weekly basis. Findings from the routine post-mortems can be tracked in a graph with the results grouped into categories. Evaluation and tracking post- mortem findings will provide information regarding potential improvements to the flock health and management program that can help reduce future mortality.\n\n**A post-mortem is recommended if**:\n\n✓ There is a rise in mortality or culling\n✓ There is a rise in the number of ill birds or disease is suspected\n✓ For quality control purposes\nChapter 2 of this guide provides guidance for sampling techniques. A veterinarian and/or a diagnostic laboratory can provide additional information on sampling techniques and shipping methods for diagnostic testing.\n\n## 1.2 Bird Sampling for a Post-Mortem\n\nWhen mortality is unusually high, a post- mortem exam should be conducted on birds that are recently deceased. A recently dead or euthanized bird can be refrigerated if a post- mortem cannot be conducted immediately. It is not recommended to conduct a post-mortem on a non-refrigerated bird that has been dead for more than several hours because decomposition may make diagnosis difficult.\n\nIf the goal is to understand the main cause of **incidental mortality**, then it is best to look at all the dead birds for a given day and repeat the process on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. It is important to repeat the post-mortem regularly. Repeating the process regularly and graphing the data provides a better understanding of the main cause of mortality which, in turn, allows targeted adjustments to a management program.\n\nIf a bird is ill or a disease is suspected in the flock, make notes of your observations prior to euthanizing. Include observations regarding breathing patterns, posture, feather ruffling, discharge from the nose or eyes, general bird condition and appearance, and bird mobility. Also make notes regarding general flock distribution and behavior within the house, any unusual sounds (i.e., coughing or snicking), and any unusual fecal observations.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Illustration of chickens in a coop under hanging lights.)\n\n## 1.3 Equipment for a Post-Mortem\n\n✓ Gloves\n✓ Forceps\n✓ Scissors\n✓ Knife and/or scalpel\n✓ Bone shears (may be necessary for older birds)\n✓ Tweezers\n✓ Well-lit area with a flat surface\n✓ Access to soap and water\n✓ Paper towels\n✓ Bag or bin for disposables\nSafety first! Always follow safety guidelines when using sharp tools and instruments.\n\n## 1.4 Tools for Submitting Samples\n\n✓ Plastic bags with closures\n✓ Sampling jars and tubes\n✓ 10% Formalin\n✓ Swabs\n✓ Transport medium (bacteria, viral)\n✓ Cooler with ice or cold pack to transport samples\n✓ Syringes and tubes (blood samples)\n✓ FTA cards\n✓ Marking pens\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\nSafety first! Always follow safety guidelines when using sharps.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of four FTA cards)\n\n## Exam Overview\n\n## Exam Sequence\n\nCollect flock health and history Prepare sampling plan and materials Euthanasia Correct disposal and thorough cleaning and disinfection of surfaces Internal visual exam External visual exam\n\n## 2.1 Collecting Flock History and Health\n\nTo understand mortality, it is critical to **collect as much historical information** about the flock as possible. This information will support an accurate diagnosis. An example of a flock history record form is given in chapter 8 of this guide. The form has some specific information requested such as age, breed or line, vaccinations and medications delivered. It is helpful to provide notes on management practices, feed form, and water consumption. Additionally, disease characteristics such as recurring issues and mortality patterns should be noted.\n\nClosely examine the live birds in the house prior to the post-mortem if the issue or disease appears to afflict most of the flock. Make note of the **flock health and history** (see chapter 8 for an example form) that includes the general appearance of birds (feathering, weight, body condition, pigmentation), the incidence of any injuries, appearance of fecal and cecal droppings, respiratory characteristics (discharge, inflammation, breathing patterns), skeletal issues, and any other abnormalities (behavioral observations, flock distribution and activity level, etc.).\n\nCollecting the flock health and history information will also provide direction about **which samples to collect**. The numbers and types of samples can be narrowed to save time, money and provide a more accurate diagnosis. Give your veterinarian the flock health and history information and they can help you narrow the sample list. The following sections will provide guidance on identifying, labeling, packaging, and shipping samples to optimize avian health testing.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A man in a dark environment is writing on a clipboard.)\n\n## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance\n\nPrimary reasons to collect samples during a post-mortem are:\n\n✔ to verify the absence or presence of an infectious disease agent within the flock\n✔ to verify the application of vaccine(s) and to confirm flock immunity after vaccination\n✔ to confirm organ development or irregular post-mortem findings\nPrimary samples that may be collected from birds for diagnostic testing include:\n\n✔ Blood\n✓ Cleft palate, tracheal or choanal swabs\n✓ Feces\n✔ Organ or tissue\n\n## Quality and quantity\n\n✔ Good quality and correct quantity are required so the lab can use the sample(s) to complete diagnostic testing efficiently and accurately. Bad quality samples will cause questionable test results.\n✓ Inadequate sample quantity will not provide enough material to accurately conduct diagnostics.\n✓ Inadequate number of samples submitted or samples that do not represent the flock can lead to incorrect assumptions about the immunity or health status of the flock.\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo.)\n\n## Identification\n\n✓ Correct label and sample identification are required so that the lab can conduct testing and report results directly to the correct location, production manager, and veterinarian.\n✓ Poorly labelled samples lead to poor traceability and may delay the result report.\n✔ If no label is provided, the sample may be discarded by the lab.\n\n## Packaging and timing of sample shipment\n\n✓ Correct packaging and good timing for shipment reduces the risk of sample spoilage and possibility of testing delays.\n✔ Poor packaging increases the risk of sample contamination, damage, and spoilage.\n✓ If samples are submitted late, results may be received too late to reduce the biosecurity risk for the flock or farm.\n✓ Samples degrade over time and samples that are held too long have poor quality and cannot be used for testing.\n\n## Storing a portion of the sample\n\n✓ For blood samples, it is recommended to store a portion of the serum from the blood sample for the life of the flock. This can be very helpful as a reference sample.\n\n## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance\n\nBlood samples are routinely collected from flocks to test for poultry diseases and verify the immune response (titers) of the flock following vaccination. During a post-mortem session, blood may also be collected for these testing reasons:\n\nSpecific testing methodology, amount of\nblood needed, equipment required, etc. should\nbe specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or\ncompany QA department.\nTo test for disease freedom, blood may be\nused to test for Mycoplasma, Avian Influenza (Al),\nand Salmonella and other diseases that are not\nincluded in the vaccination program.\nTo verify immune response (titers), blood may\nbe collected prior to and several weeks after the\nvaccination of the broiler breeder flock. To verify\nthe immune response and the uniformity of\nantibody response to the vaccine(s), ELISA tests\nare traditionally used to verify the titer level or\nsero-conversion in birds post-vaccination.\nFor live vaccines, collect blood approximately\n3 weeks after vaccination.\nFor inactivated (killed) vaccines, collect blood\napproximately 4 to 5 weeks after vaccination.\nTo test for specific concerns (i.e., toxins, blood\nchemistry profile, etc.), blood may be collected to\nverify the health status of the bird(s) and to identify\nany specific concerns.\nFecal samples may be requested as a follow-up to other testing (environmental swab) or may be used for routine monitoring during post-mortem evaluations to assess the gastro-intestinal health of the flock. Specific sampling methodology and amount needed should be specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or company QA department.\n\nTo test for disease freedom, litter or fecal samples\nmay be used to test for *Salmonella*.\nTo test for intestinal parasites, fecal samples may\nbe collected at specific times to verify if there\nis a coccidial or worm infestation that may be\nchallenging the flock.\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\n\n## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\nCleft palate, tracheal or choanal swabs are routinely collected from flocks to test for respiratory diseases. These swabs can be part of the post- mortem evaluation and diagnostic process and can be collected pre or post-euthanasia. Precise testing methodology, number of birds to sample per airspace or barn, tools and supplies required should be specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or company QA department.\n\nTo test for disease freedom, cleft palate or\ntracheal swabs may be used to test for Infectious\nLaryngotracheitis (ILT), Avian Influenza (AI),\nMycoplasma synoviae (MS), or Mycoplasma\ngallisepticum (MG). Cloacal swabs can be used to\ntest for Avian Influenza (Al) and Infectious Bursal\nDisease (IBD).\nTo test for Infectious Bronchitis (IB) or Infectious\nBursal Disease (IBD) challenges, choanal swabs\nmay be collected for testing.\nSwabs may be required after suspect blood\nresults from routine screening tests for\nrespiratory disease, when abnormal respiratory\nsigns are seen in a flock, and during situations\nwhen there is an increased risk of an infectious\navian respiratory disease in the immediate area\nnear the flock or farm.\nOrgan or tissue samples may be collected to test for various poultry diseases or to examine any pathological or histological changes in the tissue.\n\nSpecific sampling methodology (which tissues\nare needed, how much tissue, quantity of birds\nto sample, etc.), the method of tissue submission\nand storage (fixed tissue, fresh tissue, or frozen\ntissue) and any additional requirements should\nbe specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or\ncompany QA department.\nSamples may be taken from recently-dead\nbirds or from birds that have recently been\neuthanized. Samples should not be collected\nfrom deteriorating carcasses or decomposing\nbirds.\nFor fresh samples, the tissue or organ should be\nplaced in a sample bag and kept cool (refrigerator\nor cooler) immediately after collection and until\nsamples arrive at the lab.\n\n## Euthanasia\n\n## 3.1 Euthanasia Definition and Goals\n\nEuthanasia is defined\\* as a \"method of killing that minimizes pain, distress, and anxiety experienced by the animal prior to loss of consciousness and causes rapid loss of consciousness followed by cardiac or respiratory arrest and death.\" For a post-mortem process, if live poultry are used, birds must be euthanized to evaluate the internal organs.\n\n## These key factors should be achieved for euthanasia:\n\n✓ a process that minimizes pain, anxiety, and distress of the bird prior to loss of consciousness\n✓ a rapid loss of consciousness and an irreversible, efficient death of the bird\n✓ a procedure that is humane and completed with respect to the bird being euthanized, and\n✓ a method that can be completed by competent and trained staff.\n\\*The current definition is from the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals, 2020 Edition available at: (https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/ Guidelines-on-Euthanasia-2020.pdf) The method of euthanasia used for an individual chicken should be selected with regards to:\n\n✓ the location where the evaluation will take place (i.e., farm or laboratory)\n✓ the focus of the post-mortem and if any specific organs or samples are required\n✓ the age and size of bird and number of birds to be euthanized\n✓ personnel involved (training, compliance, skill) and safety considerations\n✓ the availability of euthanasia equipment\n✓ national poultry or regulatory guidelines for euthanasia that may restrict the method(s) used.\n\n## 3.2 Manual Euthanasia\n\n1. Hold the bird securely by both legs (between the hocks and feet).\n2. Place your other hand at the base of the chicken's head.\n3. Gently pull the head toward your knee and rotate your wrist/hand so that you will dislocate the neck at the point where the head and neck meet.\n4. Check to verify that the technique was effective by feeling for the gap in the neck.\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram showing the manual euthanasia of a chicken. The diagram is split into four steps. Step 1 shows a hand holding the chicken by both legs. Step 2 shows another hand holding the base of the chicken's head. Step 3 shows an arrow indicating the direction to pull the head. Step 4 shows a close-up of the chicken's head, with an arrow indicating the gap in the neck.)\n\n## **External Visual Examination**\n\nInspect the external physical characteristics of the bird:\n\n1. Feathers\n• coverage\n• cleanliness\n• condition\n2. Head condition\n• eyes\n• ears\n• nostrils\n• beak\n• comb\n• wattle\n3. Skin condition and integrity\n4.

Cloaca and tail\n\n## 4.1 Feathers\n\n1. Feathers can be inspected on live or recently culled birds. Inspect the feathers on the body. Check feathers for:\n✓ Coverage\n✓ Cleanliness\n✓ Condition\n2. Extend the wings and check the primary feathers for shape and abnormalities.\n3. Inspect the feathers for stress marks.\n4. Inspect feathers for growth gaps.\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken with an overlay of the number 1)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken with an overlay of the number 2)\n!\\[Image description\\](A magnified feather with stress marks and an overlay of the number 3)\n!\\[Image description\\](A magnified feather with growth gaps and an overlay of the number 4)\nStress marks in feathers Growth gaps in feathers Normal feather development Irregular feather development Scan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 4.2 Skin Condition and Integrity\n\nCheck the skin for\n\n✓ Signs of external parasites (mites, lice, etc.)\n✓ Scratches or other injuries\n✓ Dehydration (dehydrated birds will have dry skin and elevated scales on the legs; older dehydrated birds will have a dry, scaly comb).\nFoot of hydrated bird Feathered Areas Depluming Mite - burrows into feather shaft causes birds to pull out feathers.\n\nVent Region Foot of dehydrated bird Poultry Lice - tiny, yellow colored. Egg clusters are attached at the base of feather shafts.\n\nFowl Mite Black, dirty, feathers caused by accumulation of mite droppings and dried blood.\n\nUnder Wing Fowl Tick - tiny tick that sticks to skin and causes red spots.\n\nLegs and Feet Scaly Leg Mite raised, uneven, crusty and/or thickening scales.\n\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 4.3 Feet, Legs, and Skeletal Health\n\nEvaluate the condition of the feet (foot pads, toes and toenails). Inspect for any litter or manure accumulation, ulcers, and foot or toe damage. Inspect the legs for overall health condition.\nTake the weight of the legs with your index finger. With your thumb feel for hard nodules or inflammations in the Achilles tendon.\nCheck for swelling of the hock joint.\nEvaluate leg straightness. Hold the legs at the natural width for the frame size of each individual bird. Holding the legs either too far apart or too close together will make them appear crooked.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken's leg labeled with the number 1.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken's legs labeled with the number 2. Arrow pointing to Achilles tendons.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken's leg labeled with the number 3.

The keel bone is the pronounced bone that extends from the sternum and runs axially over the midline. It is located ventral to the heart and anchors the muscles used for wing motion (pectoralis major and pectoralis minor). Palpate the keel bone and inspect it for curvatures or bends.\n2. The keel bone also can be visually inspected after euthanasia and breast skin removal.\n!\\[Image description\\](An image shows two close-up views of a chicken's keel bone area. The top image shows the exterior shape of the bone with a dotted line indicating its curvature. The bottom image shows a similar view, possibly after skin removal, with a dotted line highlighting the keel bone's position.)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo.)\n\n## 4.4 Head Condition\n\n## Head\n\nCheck the head for any swelling\n\n## Eyes and Ears\n\nCheck eyes and ears for redness, swelling and discharge.\n\n## Nostrils and Beak\n\nCheck the beak shape. Check the beak, internally and externally including the corners for abnormalities such as lesions from mycotoxins.\nCheck the nostrils for blockages and buildup of materials. Apply pressure to the top of the nostril to check for mucus.\n\n## Comb and Wattle\n\nObserve the size and color of the wattle and comb relative to age. (See following page for examples of comb and wattle appearance at different ages.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken head being examined by gloved hands, labeled with the number 1)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken head being examined by gloved hands, labeled with the number 2)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken's beak being examined by gloved hands, labeled with the number 3)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken nostril being examined by gloved hands, labeled with the number 4)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 4.4 Head Condition\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\nThese photos illustrate normal appearance, size and coloration of the comb and wattle relative to age of broiler breeder chickens: 2-week old chick 11-week old female 11-week old male 14-week old female 14-week old male 21-week old female 21-week old male 32-week old female 32-week old male Scan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 4.5 Development and Body Condition\n\n## Body weight\n\nWeigh the bird. Record and compare the weight to what is expected for the age, sex, and line.\nVerification of the body weight and documentation of body condition (fleshing and fat deposition) of birds are recommended as part of the flock evaluation process and post-mortem session. For example, post-mortem sessions can allow farm managers and veterinarians to verify possible biological reasons for underweightbirds or those that have inadequate fleshing and/or fat deposition. Conversely, if broiler breeders are overweight and over-conditioned (excessive fleshing and fat scores) during a post-mortem session, this may help explain mortality during the onset of egg production and fertility concerns in a broiler breeder flock.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb700 Slow Feather Breeder Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb Cobb500 Slow Feather Breeder.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb700 Fast Feather Breeder Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb500 Fast Feather Breeder Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb MX Male Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb Male Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb MV Male.)\nYou can find the expected bodyweight for each of our lines in our supplements, available online at Cobb-Vantress.com under *Resources \\> Product-Supplements*\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\n\n## 4.5 Development and Body Condition\n\n## Fleshing, Fat Deposition and Uniformity - Females\n\nEvaluate the fleshing and fat deposition for each individual bird.\nUse the chart to determine if flesh score is correct for the bird's age.\nPalpate the pelvic bone to assess fat accumulation. Hens (in the production phase) may have visible fat\ndeposition underneath the skin on the bottom (ventral) portion of each wing. Parallel to this fat deposit\nis a large blood vessel. This combination is often referred to as the fat vein. The fat vein can be used\nto determine subcutaneous fat deposition. Fat accumulation can also be visually inspected during the\ninternal examination.\n| Optimum Fleshing Score and Pelvic Fat for Females Given as Age and Percentage of Flock within Each Score | Age (weeks) | 2 | 3 | 4 | Pelvic Fat |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | - | - | - | ---------- |\n| | 12 | 70% | 30% | | |\n| | 16 | 40% | 60% | | |\n| | 19 | \\<10% | 60% | 30% | \\>65% |\n| | 20 | \\<5% | 60% | 35% | \\>75% |\n| | 21 | | 60% | 40% | \\>85% |\n| | 22 | | 60% | 40% | \\>90% |\n\n| Explanation of female fleshing scores | FLESHING 1 | Substantially under the desired level of fleshing. | |\n| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | - |\n| | FLESHING 2 | Ideal breast shape for a 12 week-old female. | |\n| | FLESHING 3 | Breast fleshing shape at 16 to 25 weeks during preparation for lay. | |\n| | FLESHING 4 | Breast fleshing shape at 19 to 25 weeks during preparation for lay. | |\n| | FLESHING 5 | Oversized breast muscle. | |\n\n## 4.5 Development and Body Condition\n\n## Fleshing and Uniformity - Males\n\nEvaluate the fleshing.\nUse the chart (right) and table below to determine if flesh score is correct for the bird's age. See Cobb supplements for more information on male fleshing.\n| Age (weeks) | 2 | 2.5 | 3 | 4 | Fleshing Score (Weighted Average) |\n| ----------- | - | --- | - | - | --------------------------------- |\n| 20 | 25% | 50% | 25% | | 2.50 |\n| 25 | 15% | 55% | 30% | | 2.60 |\n| 30 | 5% | 60% | 35% | | 2.65 |\n| 35 | 3% | 60% | 35% | 2% | 2.70 |\n| 40 | 1% | 53% | 40% | 6% | 2.80 |\n| 45 | 1% | 50% | 40% | 9% | 2.85 |\n| 50 | | 45% | 43% | 12% | 2.90 |\n| 55 | | 40% | 45% | 15% | 2.95 |\n| 60 | | 30% | 55% | 15% | 3.00 |\n\n| FLESHING 1 | Explanation of male fleshing scores | |\n| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | - |\n| | Severely under conditioned breast and very thin.

Check for a pasty vent (cloaca) and accumulation of urate deposits. For males, check the color (redness) for active breeding roosters (see section 5.7 for more photos and information).\nInspect the tail. The tail should be well- feathered. Any signs of tail pecking can be an indication of stress, high density, or nutritional deficiencies.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken's cloaca, clean and free of abnormalities.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken's tail that is well-developed and well-feathered.)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## Post-Mortem Internal Visual Examination\n\n## 5.1 Examination Sequence\n\n1. It is recommended to wet the carcass using water containing a disinfectant after euthanasia to keep feathers and down from interfering with the post-mortem examination.\n\n2. Remove the breast skin 3. Subdermal and femoral head exam 4. Examine the legs 5. Examine the head and neck region 6. Examine the thoracic cavity and coelomic cavity (space where internal organs are suspended).\n\n3. Examine the reproductive organs\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\n\n## 5.2 Subdermal and Femoral Head Examination\n\nRemove the skin from the breast.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a hand removing the skin from a chicken's breast, labeled with the number 1.)\nExamine the keel and breast to check the condition of the bird and check for any abnormalities (i.e. crooked keel; irregular color of the breast). Note fleshing and breast shape.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a chicken's breast with the keel and breast visible, labeled with the number 2.)\nSupport the carcass and elevate the leg to 90 degrees. Pull the leg from the joint (for older birds) or pop the femoral head out (for younger birds) by pressing the thigh down and towards the back of the carcass.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a hand supporting a chicken's leg and thigh, labeled with the number 3.)\nInspect the femoral head.

The feed is held here for stabilization and storage. It then passes to the proventriculus where digestive enzymes are added. The crop is where the breakdown of feed starts.\nExamine the crop for size (correct based on age and weight) and cut the crop to examine the inside. Evaluate the contents of the crop (i.e., feed, litter, etc.) and look for irregularities on the internal surface of the crop (i.е., fungal growth). A fungal infection by Candida can cause whitish, thickened patches inside the crop.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a crop with label 'closed crop')\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a crop cut open to evaluate contents)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 5.4 Head and Neck Region\n\n## Brain\n\nRemove the feathers and skin from the head.\nUsing scissors, cut the base of the skull.\nCarefully cut along both sides of the skull and the front.

It is the first organ where the absorbed\nnutrients pass. The liver is a filter (detoxifier). Liver color\ncan vary based on the diet and age of the bird. Chicks\ntypically have a yellow liver (due to yolk absorption) while\nolder birds have a dark red liver as shown here. Look\nfor a difference in color, spots and inflammation of the\ncapsule around the liver (perihepatitis). The edges of the\nliver should be well-defined. Samples of the liver can be\ncollected using swabs (as seen in the photo) or a small\namount of irregular liver tissue can be placed in a sample\njar to submit to the lab.\nElevate the corner of the liver to view the gall bladder. The\ngall bladder releases bile fluid into the digestive tract to\nsupport fat digestion. The normal color of the gall bladder\nshould be dark green. A large gall bladder would indicate\na high level of hemoglobin turnover.\nRemove the liver with gall bladder and spleen attached.\nThe spleen is a small, round, soft organ similar in color to\nthe liver. The spleen is normally about 1 inch (2.5 to 3.0 cm)\nlong and is about the size of a large olive.

Air sacs should be clear and free of exudate.\n!\\[Image description\\](Photograph of the internal organs of a bird, labeled with '1' and an arrow pointing to 'Air Sacs'.)\nThe lungs are firmly attached to the ribs in the upper thoracic cavity under the heart.\n!\\[Image description\\](Photograph of the internal organs of a bird, labeled with '2'. Labels indicate 'Breast plate', 'Heart', 'Liver', and 'Lung'.)\nThe lungs should be a bright pink/red color (as shown in the photo), without signs of inflammation. Normal lung tissue is spongy and no nodules or irregular texture should be palpated.\n!\\[Image description\\](Photograph of a healthy lung labeled '3'.)\nRemove the lungs on each side to view the ribs. Check the shape and spacing of the ribs for uniformity. Abnormal findings may include bead like pearls on the ends of the ribs (i.e., rickets). This photo indicates normal rib appearance.\n!\\[Image description\\](Photograph of a section of the ribs of a bird, labeled with '4' and an arrow pointing to 'Ribs'.)\n!\\[Image description\\](QR code with the text 'Scan to access supplementary materials')\n!\\[Image description\\](Logo of 'Cobb')\n\n## 5.5 Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region\n\n## Gizzard, Proventriculus\n\nAfter the liver is removed, the proventriculus and gizzard are clearly visible. The proventriculus is where enzymes are mixed with the feed and digestion continues.\nRemove the gizzard and proventriculus. Open each organ and inspect them. The photo shows a normal color and texture of the proventriculus and the gizzard.\nThe gizzard grinds food and is a very strong muscle. In the photo the koilin membrane (lining of the gizzard) has been removed. Check the gizzard for erosions and ulcerations. An erosion is a lesion only present in the membrane (koilin layer). An ulceration is a lesion that has eroded through the lining to the muscle layer of the gizzard.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image showing proventriculus and gizzard labeled with arrows.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image showing gizzard, proventriculus, crop and mouth labeled with arrows.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image showing gizzard and koilin layer of the gizzard labeled with arrows.)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 5.5 Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region\n\n## Intestines\n\nThe duodenum, jejunum and ileum are classed as the small intestine. The duodenum is the most efficient at breaking down nutrients but more absorption takes place in the jejunum and ileum due to the larger surface area.\nRemove the intestinal tract and examine. The pancreas is in the center of the loop of the duodenum and is normally a pale color (as shown in this photo). The pancreas secretes enzymes and pH neutralizers into the duodenum for further breakdown of nutrients.\nMeckel's diverticulum (yolk sac absorption site) marks the end of the jejunum and the start of the ileum. In young birds, the yolk from the egg is absorbed here. Evaluate meckel's diverticulum for yolk sac retention. This picture indicates a normal sized meckel's diverticulum. A large meckel's diverticulum is indicative of a poorly absorbed yolk sac in young birds.\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of the intestinal tract of a bird, labeled with anatomical features.

Mucus protects the intestinal wall from being infected with pathogens inside the lumen.\nIn a normal healthy bird the intestine should be pale in color.\nAn abnormal finding might include the presence of hemorrhages, irregular color or thickness of the ingesting, and irregular texture of the mucosal lining of the intestine.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of scissors opening the length of the intestinal tract.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of intestine with mucus layer visible.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of normal intestine (feed removed).)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of abnormal intestine.)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 5.5 Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region\n\n## Ceca, Cecal Tonsils\n\nThe ceca are located where the small and large intestines join. They are only emptied on average 1 to 2 times a day. The ceca droppings can be seen on the floor of the poultry house and are a softer, stickier and more watery in consistency than a 'normal' dropping. Sizes may vary among birds. There is one pair of ceca. The ceca are blind pouches (they do not connect to another point).\nUse scissors to open the ceca to examine the contents.\nThe cecal tonsils are at the joint between the ceca and large intestines. The cecal tonsils are lymph nodules and will respond to an infection. Evaluate cecal tonsils for cleanliness and size. Normal cecal tonsils should be clean and without red inflammation.\nAbnormal cecal tonsils may be red and/or inflamed (swollen).\n!\\[Image description\\](Illustration of the ceca and cecal tonsils in poultry with labels: 'Small intestine', 'Cecum', 'Large intestine', 'Normal fecal dropping with white urate cap', 'Normal cecal dropping', 'Normal Cecal Tonsils (no swelling, pale in color)', 'Abnormal Cecal Tonsils (note inflammation and redness)'.)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 5.5 Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region\n\nKidneys, Ureters\n\nThe kidneys are located under the intestinal tract in a fixed position on either side of the backbone (vertebral column). The kidneys should be symmetrical in appearance and consist of 3 lobules (cranial, middle and caudal) on each side. They should be flat, firm and light purple (similar to the photo). They should not show any signs of blood congestion.\nThe ureters appear as small, clear tubes and may be difficult to see. However, if urates are present, the ureters may be easier to locate. No urates (white deposits as seen in the photos) should be present in the kidneys or ureters.\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram showing the location of lobules in the kidney and a photo of white urate deposits in the ureters, indicating dehydration.)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 5.5 Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region\n\n## Bursa of Fabricius\n\nAfter removing the intestinal tract, the\nbursa of fabricius can be located near\nthe cloaca. This lymphoid organ is\nimportant for immunity and antibody\nproduction in chickens. The size may\nvary based on the age of the bird and\nthe vaccination program used for\nGumboro (Infectious Bursal Disease).\nThe bursa will normally decrease in size\nas the bird ages and may be difficult to\nlocate in older birds.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of an anatomical dissection labeled '1' showing the location of the Bursa.)\nOn post-mortem inspection, the bursa\nwill appear as a small, round, pale-\ncolored sac.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of an anatomical dissection labeled '2' showing the Bursa.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of an anatomical dissection labeled '3' showing the Bursa.)\nAfter opening it, you should see several\nsmall folds inside the bursa. Evaluate\nthe bursa for irregular size (e.g. much\nsmaller than expected for the age\nof the bird), swelling (e.g. presence of edema and\nfolds may not be present if bursa is swollen), and\nirregular coloring (e.g.: small pin-point blood spots\nor hemorrhages).\nIn young birds, the bursa can also be examined and\nremoved in post-mortem birds by carefully cutting\nthe skin on the dorsal side just above the tail.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of an anatomical dissection labeled '4' showing the Bursa.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo.)\n\n## 5.6 Female Reproductive Tract\n\nIn the female reproductive system, only the left ovary will develop and mature. The ovary is firmly attached to the back of the hen's abdominal wall very near the kidneys.\n\nIn mature hens, the ovary is a mass of sacs called follicles and each follicle contains a yellowish ovum (or yolk). The follicle and yolk grow over a 10-day period to the size of a yolk in a normal egg. In a mature follicle, there is an area without blood vessels (the stigma) where the follicle has split apart to release the yolk into the oviduct. If the follicle splits at a point other than the stigma, blood vessels may rupture and blood may be seen in the egg.\n\nApproximately every 24 hours, one mature ovum from the ovaries is passed into the oviduct which lies along the backbone and connects the ovary to the cloaca. In mature hens, the oviduct is about 63.5 cm (26 inches) long and consists of the infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina, each with their own function.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of the female reproductive tract of a hen, labeled with the following parts: Stalk of ovary, Ovary, Empty follicle, Stigma, Mature Ovum, Infundibulum, Magnum, Oviduct, Isthmus, Uterus, Papillae, Vagina, Cloaca, Large intestine, Rudiment of right ovary.)\n| Location | Action | Time in location (hours) | Normal length cm (in) |\n| -------- | ------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |\n| Infundibulum | Ovum fertilized | 0.25 | 2 (5) |\n| Magnum | Albumen is collected | 3 | 33 (13) |\n| Isthmus | Inner and outer shell membranes are established | 1.25 | 4 (10) |\n| Uterus | Shell and cuticle pigment are added | 20.75 | 4.2 (10.5) |\n| Vagina | Passes through to cloaca | \\<0.25 | 4 (10) |\n\n(Table courtesy of Philip Clauer, Penn State University, available at: https://extension.psu.edu/hen-reproduction)\n\n## 5.6 Female Reproductive Anatomy\n\n## Cloaca\n\n1.

One ovum is in the infundibulum at the start of the oviduct. This is where fertilization occurs. A second ovum is in the isthmus (where the shell membrane is added) at the end of the oviduct where it joins the uterus.\n\n3. Remnants of the right ovary are shown in the photo.

They can be visualized in day-old male chicks and increase in size as the male grows and matures. In immature males, each testis is about the size of a grain of rice. In mature males, the size of the testes will be much larger as shown in the photo. Inspect the testes for symmetry, color and size (as it relates to bird age).\n\n3. In the picture a white dotted line is overlaying the ducti deferens. While moving through the ductus, the sperm matures. Inspect the ducti deferens for any abnormalities and obstipation.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](The image shows three different views of the male chicken reproductive system.

Be sure to make note of any mobility issues or spinal deformities on your post-mortem form.\n\nIf abnormalities are apparent, it is suggested to collect tissue for both histology and bacteriology.\n\nPlease note that to view the spinal column, it is best to cut the vertebral column vertically. Making this cut through the vertebrae can be difficult without a large sharp knife or bone saw.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of a bird skeleton from the front.)\n\n## 6.0 Spinal Examination\n\n1. To view the spine, the breast plate must be completely removed and all the organs should be removed from the thoracic and coelomic cavities including the lungs and kidneys. After removal, it may be helpful to wash the carcass to remove blood and tissue. Inspect the spine for lesions. The ribs should be evenly spaced. Note any ribs that appear close together.\n\n2. Using a knife or bone saw, cut across the spinal column vertically.\n\n3. Split the spinal column open vertically. The spinal cord will be laying inside the vertebral column (as shown in the photo). It should be white in color and not appear pinched by any vertebrae.\n\n4. There is only one free thoracic vertebra, the articulation point, between the anterior thoracic vertebrae (which are fused) and the posterior vertebrae (lumbar vertebrae are fused; see diagram). As such, the free thoracic vertebra is subject to greater mechanical stress, trauma, dislocation and infection than other vertebrae. Infections and dislocation of the vertebra at this position can lead to decreased mobility and paralysis.\n\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of the carcass after removing breast plate and organs to expose the spine, used to inspect for lesions and assess rib spacing.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of the carcass after removing breast plate and organs to expose the spine, used to inspect for lesions and assess rib spacing.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram showing the spinal cord and vertebrae.)\nVertebrae Spinal cord Free thoracic vertebra\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram illustrating the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (fused).)\nThoracic vertebrae (fused) Free thoracic vertebra (articulation point) Lumbar vertebrae (fused)\n\n## Concluding the Post-Mortem: Checklist\n\n## 7\n\n✓ Review data collected on the post-mortem forms and fill in any missing information.\n✓ Ensure all samples are labelled correctly.

    "## 1.1 Reasons for Conducting a Post-Mortem\n\nA post-mortem dissection (necropsy) of a broiler breeder is a procedure used by veterinarians, farm managers, or growers to investigate mortality of birds in a flock. First, an external visual exam is conducted for any obvious outward signs indicating the cause of death. Next, an internal visual examination is conducted to obtain further diagnostic information. Samples can be collected and sent to a laboratory for diagnostic tests.\n\nConducting a post-mortem on a regular basis can help provide insightful information about incidental flock mortality, be a very useful assessment to provide feedback on poultry health programs, and be an important diagnostic tool when a disease is suspected in a flock. A good way to proceed is to do a post- mortem of all the mortality on a specific day and repeat this process on a weekly basis. Findings from the routine post-mortems can be tracked in a graph with the results grouped into categories. Evaluation and tracking post- mortem findings will provide information regarding potential improvements to the flock health and management program that can help reduce future mortality.\n\n**A post-mortem is recommended if**:\n\n✓ There is a rise in mortality or culling\n✓ There is a rise in the number of ill birds or disease is suspected\n✓ For quality control purposes\nChapter 2 of this guide provides guidance for sampling techniques. A veterinarian and/or a diagnostic laboratory can provide additional information on sampling techniques and shipping methods for diagnostic testing.\n",
    "## 1.2 Bird Sampling for a Post-Mortem\n\nWhen mortality is unusually high, a post- mortem exam should be conducted on birds that are recently deceased. A recently dead or euthanized bird can be refrigerated if a post- mortem cannot be conducted immediately. It is not recommended to conduct a post-mortem on a non-refrigerated bird that has been dead for more than several hours because decomposition may make diagnosis difficult.\n\nIf the goal is to understand the main cause of **incidental mortality**, then it is best to look at all the dead birds for a given day and repeat the process on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. It is important to repeat the post-mortem regularly. Repeating the process regularly and graphing the data provides a better understanding of the main cause of mortality which, in turn, allows targeted adjustments to a management program.\n\nIf a bird is ill or a disease is suspected in the flock, make notes of your observations prior to euthanizing. Include observations regarding breathing patterns, posture, feather ruffling, discharge from the nose or eyes, general bird condition and appearance, and bird mobility. Also make notes regarding general flock distribution and behavior within the house, any unusual sounds (i.e., coughing or snicking), and any unusual fecal observations.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Illustration of chickens in a coop under hanging lights.)\n\n## 1.3 Equipment for a Post-Mortem\n\n✓ Gloves\n✓ Forceps\n✓ Scissors\n✓ Knife and/or scalpel\n✓ Bone shears (may be necessary for older birds)\n✓ Tweezers\n✓ Well-lit area with a flat surface\n✓ Access to soap and water\n✓ Paper towels\n✓ Bag or bin for disposables\nSafety first! Always follow safety guidelines when using sharp tools and instruments.\n",

    "## 2.1 Collecting Flock History and Health\n\nTo understand mortality, it is critical to **collect as much historical information** about the flock as possible. This information will support an accurate diagnosis. An example of a flock history record form is given in chapter 8 of this guide. The form has some specific information requested such as age, breed or line, vaccinations and medications delivered. It is helpful to provide notes on management practices, feed form, and water consumption. Additionally, disease characteristics such as recurring issues and mortality patterns should be noted.\n\nClosely examine the live birds in the house prior to the post-mortem if the issue or disease appears to afflict most of the flock. Make note of the **flock health and history** (see chapter 8 for an example form) that includes the general appearance of birds (feathering, weight, body condition, pigmentation), the incidence of any injuries, appearance of fecal and cecal droppings, respiratory characteristics (discharge, inflammation, breathing patterns), skeletal issues, and any other abnormalities (behavioral observations, flock distribution and activity level, etc.).\n\nCollecting the flock health and history information will also provide direction about **which samples to collect**. The numbers and types of samples can be narrowed to save time, money and provide a more accurate diagnosis. Give your veterinarian the flock health and history information and they can help you narrow the sample list. The following sections will provide guidance on identifying, labeling, packaging, and shipping samples to optimize avian health testing.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A man in a dark environment is writing on a clipboard.)\n\n## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance\n\nPrimary reasons to collect samples during a post-mortem are:\n\n✔ to verify the absence or presence of an infectious disease agent within the flock\n✔ to verify the application of vaccine(s) and to confirm flock immunity after vaccination\n✔ to confirm organ development or irregular post-mortem findings\nPrimary samples that may be collected from birds for diagnostic testing include:\n\n✔ Blood\n✓ Cleft palate, tracheal or choanal swabs\n✓ Feces\n✔ Organ or tissue\n",
    "## Quality and quantity\n\n✔ Good quality and correct quantity are required so the lab can use the sample(s) to complete diagnostic testing efficiently and accurately. Bad quality samples will cause questionable test results.\n✓ Inadequate sample quantity will not provide enough material to accurately conduct diagnostics.\n✓ Inadequate number of samples submitted or samples that do not represent the flock can lead to incorrect assumptions about the immunity or health status of the flock.\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo.)\n\n## Identification\n\n✓ Correct label and sample identification are required so that the lab can conduct testing and report results directly to the correct location, production manager, and veterinarian.\n✓ Poorly labelled samples lead to poor traceability and may delay the result report.\n✔ If no label is provided, the sample may be discarded by the lab.\n\n## Packaging and timing of sample shipment\n\n✓ Correct packaging and good timing for shipment reduces the risk of sample spoilage and possibility of testing delays.\n✔ Poor packaging increases the risk of sample contamination, damage, and spoilage.\n✓ If samples are submitted late, results may be received too late to reduce the biosecurity risk for the flock or farm.\n✓ Samples degrade over time and samples that are held too long have poor quality and cannot be used for testing.\n\n## Storing a portion of the sample\n\n✓ For blood samples, it is recommended to store a portion of the serum from the blood sample for the life of the flock. This can be very helpful as a reference sample.\n",
    "## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance\n\nBlood samples are routinely collected from flocks to test for poultry diseases and verify the immune response (titers) of the flock following vaccination. During a post-mortem session, blood may also be collected for these testing reasons:\n\nSpecific testing methodology, amount of\nblood needed, equipment required, etc. should\nbe specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or\ncompany QA department.\nTo test for disease freedom, blood may be\nused to test for Mycoplasma, Avian Influenza (Al),\nand Salmonella and other diseases that are not\nincluded in the vaccination program.\nTo verify immune response (titers), blood may\nbe collected prior to and several weeks after the\nvaccination of the broiler breeder flock. To verify\nthe immune response and the uniformity of\nantibody response to the vaccine(s), ELISA tests\nare traditionally used to verify the titer level or\nsero-conversion in birds post-vaccination.\nFor live vaccines, collect blood approximately\n3 weeks after vaccination.\nFor inactivated (killed) vaccines, collect blood\napproximately 4 to 5 weeks after vaccination.\nTo test for specific concerns (i.e., toxins, blood\nchemistry profile, etc.), blood may be collected to\nverify the health status of the bird(s) and to identify\nany specific concerns.\nFecal samples may be requested as a follow-up to other testing (environmental swab) or may be used for routine monitoring during post-mortem evaluations to assess the gastro-intestinal health of the flock. Specific sampling methodology and amount needed should be specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or company QA department.\n\nTo test for disease freedom, litter or fecal samples\nmay be used to test for *Salmonella*.\nTo test for intestinal parasites, fecal samples may\nbe collected at specific times to verify if there\nis a coccidial or worm infestation that may be\nchallenging the flock.\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\n",
    "## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\nCleft palate, tracheal or choanal swabs are routinely collected from flocks to test for respiratory diseases. These swabs can be part of the post- mortem evaluation and diagnostic process and can be collected pre or post-euthanasia. Precise testing methodology, number of birds to sample per airspace or barn, tools and supplies required should be specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or company QA department.\n\nTo test for disease freedom, cleft palate or\ntracheal swabs may be used to test for Infectious\nLaryngotracheitis (ILT), Avian Influenza (AI),\nMycoplasma synoviae (MS), or Mycoplasma\ngallisepticum (MG). Cloacal swabs can be used to\ntest for Avian Influenza (Al) and Infectious Bursal\nDisease (IBD).\nTo test for Infectious Bronchitis (IB) or Infectious\nBursal Disease (IBD) challenges, choanal swabs\nmay be collected for testing.\nSwabs may be required after suspect blood\nresults from routine screening tests for\nrespiratory disease, when abnormal respiratory\nsigns are seen in a flock, and during situations\nwhen there is an increased risk of an infectious\navian respiratory disease in the immediate area\nnear the flock or farm.\nOrgan or tissue samples may be collected to test for various poultry diseases or to examine any pathological or histological changes in the tissue.\n\nSpecific sampling methodology (which tissues\nare needed, how much tissue, quantity of birds\nto sample, etc.), the method of tissue submission\nand storage (fixed tissue, fresh tissue, or frozen\ntissue) and any additional requirements should\nbe specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or\ncompany QA department.\nSamples may be taken from recently-dead\nbirds or from birds that have recently been\neuthanized. Samples should not be collected\nfrom deteriorating carcasses or decomposing\nbirds.\nFor fresh samples, the tissue or organ should be\nplaced in a sample bag and kept cool (refrigerator\n",
    "or cooler) immediately after collection and until\nsamples arrive at the lab.\n\n# Euthanasia\n\n## 3.1 Euthanasia Definition and Goals\n\nEuthanasia is defined\\* as a \"method of killing that minimizes pain, distress, and anxiety experienced by the animal prior to loss of consciousness and causes rapid loss of consciousness followed by cardiac or respiratory arrest and death.\" For a post-mortem process, if live poultry are used, birds must be euthanized to evaluate the internal organs.\n\n## These key factors should be achieved for euthanasia:\n\n✓ a process that minimizes pain, anxiety, and distress of the bird prior to loss of consciousness\n✓ a rapid loss of consciousness and an irreversible, efficient death of the bird\n✓ a procedure that is humane and completed with respect to the bird being euthanized, and\n✓ a method that can be completed by competent and trained staff.\n\\*The current definition is from the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals, 2020 Edition available at: (https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/ Guidelines-on-Euthanasia-2020.pdf) The method of euthanasia used for an individual chicken should be selected with regards to:\n\n✓ the location where the evaluation will take place (i.e., farm or laboratory)\n✓ the focus of the post-mortem and if any specific organs or samples are required\n✓ the age and size of bird and number of birds to be euthanized\n✓ personnel involved (training, compliance, skill) and safety considerations\n✓ the availability of euthanasia equipment\n✓ national poultry or regulatory guidelines for euthanasia that may restrict the method(s) used.\n",
    "## 3.2 Manual Euthanasia\n\n1. Hold the bird securely by both legs (between the hocks and feet).\n2. Place your other hand at the base of the chicken's head.\n3. Gently pull the head toward your knee and rotate your wrist/hand so that you will dislocate the neck at the point where the head and neck meet.\n4. Check to verify that the technique was effective by feeling for the gap in the neck.\n   !\\[Image description\\](Diagram showing the manual euthanasia of a chicken.

Record and compare the weight to what is expected for the age, sex, and line.\nVerification of the body weight and documentation of body condition (fleshing and fat deposition) of birds are recommended as part of the flock evaluation process and post-mortem session. For example, post-mortem sessions can allow farm managers and veterinarians to verify possible biological reasons for underweightbirds or those that have inadequate fleshing and/or fat deposition. Conversely, if broiler breeders are overweight and over-conditioned (excessive fleshing and fat scores) during a post-mortem session, this may help explain mortality during the onset of egg production and fertility concerns in a broiler breeder flock.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb700 Slow Feather Breeder Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb Cobb500 Slow Feather Breeder.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb700 Fast Feather Breeder Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb500 Fast Feather Breeder Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb MX Male Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb Male Management Supplement.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of Cobb MV Male.)\nYou can find the expected bodyweight for each of our lines in our supplements, available online at Cobb-Vantress.com under *Resources \\> Product-Supplements*\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\n\n## 4.5 Development and Body Condition\n",

    "## 5.6 Female Reproductive Tract\n\nIn the female reproductive system, only the left ovary will develop and mature. The ovary is firmly attached to the back of the hen's abdominal wall very near the kidneys.\n\nIn mature hens, the ovary is a mass of sacs called follicles and each follicle contains a yellowish ovum (or yolk). The follicle and yolk grow over a 10-day period to the size of a yolk in a normal egg. In a mature follicle, there is an area without blood vessels (the stigma) where the follicle has split apart to release the yolk into the oviduct. If the follicle splits at a point other than the stigma, blood vessels may rupture and blood may be seen in the egg.\n\nApproximately every 24 hours, one mature ovum from the ovaries is passed into the oviduct which lies along the backbone and connects the ovary to the cloaca. In mature hens, the oviduct is about 63.5 cm (26 inches) long and consists of the infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina, each with their own function.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of the female reproductive tract of a hen, labeled with the following parts: Stalk of ovary, Ovary, Empty follicle, Stigma, Mature Ovum, Infundibulum, Magnum, Oviduct, Isthmus, Uterus, Papillae, Vagina, Cloaca, Large intestine, Rudiment of right ovary.)\n| Location | Action | Time in location (hours) | Normal length cm (in) |\n| -------- | ------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |\n| Infundibulum | Ovum fertilized | 0.25 | 2 (5) |\n| Magnum | Albumen is collected | 3 | 33 (13) |\n| Isthmus | Inner and outer shell membranes are established | 1.25 | 4 (10) |\n| Uterus | Shell and cuticle pigment are added | 20.75 | 4.2 (10.5) |\n| Vagina | Passes through to cloaca | \\<0.25 | 4 (10) |\n",

Inspect the oviduct for developmental defects.\nAfter the pullet is photo stimulated, the follicles will begin to develop and appear as a small dark colored cluster.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of the female reproductive anatomy with numbered callouts and labels for ovary, kidney, oviduct, and cloaca.)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 5.6 Female Reproductive Anatomy\n",
    "## Oviduct, Ovary in **Hens**\n\n1. After evaluation of the heart and intestines, these organs can be removed. This will allow a full view of the reproductive organs (oviduct and left ovary with developed ovum) of the hen. Inspect the oviduct for developmental abnormalities, double follicles, vascularization and infections.\n\n2. An oviduct that has been removed from a mature female is seen in the photo. One ovum is in the infundibulum at the start of the oviduct. This is where fertilization occurs. A second ovum is in the isthmus (where the shell membrane is added) at the end of the oviduct where it joins the uterus.\n\n3. Remnants of the right ovary are shown in the photo. The right ovary is non-functional but can occasionally be seen as a clear, fluid- filled cyst called the Mullerian duct. Inspect this remnant for size and clear content.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of hen organs labeled with numbers 1, 2, and 3 pointing to different organs.)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 5.6 Female Reproductive Anatomy\n\n## Follicles, Stigma in Hens\n\nRemove the follicles. Inspect for vascularization and degeneration of follicles.\nCheck follicles over 1 cm. The photo shows a hierarchy of ova. A good range is 6 to 8 follicles, \\> 1 cm each, and increasing in size.\nThe stigma is the point of rupture of the follicle during ovulation. If the follicle splits at a point other than the stigma, blood vessels may rupture.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of follicles of hens, numbered from 1 to 3. The image 1 shows a group of follicles.

    "## Infundibulum in Hens\n\nThe infundibulum engulfs and pulls mature ova that have been released from a follicle into the oviduct.\nFertilization occurs after the ovum is in the infundibulum. Normal appearance is shown in the photos. If the infundibulum does not engulf the ovum, the ovum may be reabsorbed. If not reabsorbed, the ova can accumulate in the coelomic cavity and can lead to a syndrome known as an \"internal layer\".\nAn ovum has been released and the post-ovulatory follicle is visible. The post ovulatory follicle has a hormonal function. Normal appearance should be whitish red.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of the oviduct with labels: 1) Ovum about to be released into the infundibulum, 2) Infundibulum catching an ovum, 3) Post-ovulatory follicle)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\n\n## 5.6 Female Reproductive Anatomy\n\n## Magnum, Isthmus in Hens\n\nThe magnum and isthmus shown in the photos have a normal appearance and color.\nCheck for bleeding, ulcers, and remains of albumen or yolk.\n!\\[Image description\\](Close up of Magnum)\n!\\[Image description\\](Close up of Isthmus)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n## 5.6 Female Reproductive Anatomy\n\n## Uterus, Vagina in Hens\n\nThe uterus and vagina with the sperm storage glands.

    "## Testes, Ducti Deferens\n\n1. The male chicken has two testis, located on either side of the vertebral column, near the top of the kidneys, in the coelomic cavity. After removing the liver, heart and intestinal tract, the testes will be visible.\n\n2. The testes are bean-shaped and light yellow or tan. They can be visualized in day-old male chicks and increase in size as the male grows and matures. In immature males, each testis is about the size of a grain of rice. In mature males, the size of the testes will be much larger as shown in the photo. Inspect the testes for symmetry, color and size (as it relates to bird age).\n\n3. In the picture a white dotted line is overlaying the ducti deferens. While moving through the ductus, the sperm matures. Inspect the ducti deferens for any abnormalities and obstipation.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](The image shows three different views of the male chicken reproductive system.

    "## Testes\n\nDuring post-mortem sessions, male fertility can be assessed if the testes are removed and weighed together. This information should be assessed in combination with the body weight, body conformation and general physical appearance (comb color and size, vent coloration, feather condition, etc.) of the rooster.\nAfter 30 weeks of age, the total testicular weight may decrease. However, for active roosters, the pair of testicles should always weigh \\>25 grams.\nInspect the testicles for vascularization on the surface. Normal vascularization is shown in the photo.\nCut the testes cross-sectionally and inspect. A normal testis cross-section is shown in the photo.\n!\\[Image description\\](A photograph of two testes on a digital scale, displaying a reading of 0.048 grams.)\n| Age (weeks) | Weight (grams) |\n| ----------- | -------------- |\n| 21 | 0.5 |\n| 22 | 2 |\n| 23 | 18 |\n| 24 | 24 |\n| 26 | 41 |\n| 28 | 43 |\n| 30 | 45 |\n| 40 | 42 |\n| 50 | 38 |\n| 60 | 32 |\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A pair of normal testes)\n!\\[Image description\\](Cross section of a normal testis)\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n# Spinal Examination\n\nIn some cases, examination of the spine may be necessary if mobility issues (lameness, paralysis) or spinal deformities (short stature, spinal curvature, arched back, prominent dorsal keel) are apparent upon external examination. Be sure to make note of any mobility issues or spinal deformities on your post-mortem form.\n\nIf abnormalities are apparent, it is suggested to collect tissue for both histology and bacteriology.\n\nPlease note that to view the spinal column, it is best to cut the vertebral column vertically. Making this cut through the vertebrae can be difficult without a large sharp knife or bone saw.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram of a bird skeleton from the front.)\n",
    "## 6.0 Spinal Examination\n\n1. To view the spine, the breast plate must be completely removed and all the organs should be removed from the thoracic and coelomic cavities including the lungs and kidneys. After removal, it may be helpful to wash the carcass to remove blood and tissue. Inspect the spine for lesions. The ribs should be evenly spaced. Note any ribs that appear close together.\n\n2. Using a knife or bone saw, cut across the spinal column vertically.\n\n3. Split the spinal column open vertically. The spinal cord will be laying inside the vertebral column (as shown in the photo). It should be white in color and not appear pinched by any vertebrae.\n\n4. There is only one free thoracic vertebra, the articulation point, between the anterior thoracic vertebrae (which are fused) and the posterior vertebrae (lumbar vertebrae are fused; see diagram). As such, the free thoracic vertebra is subject to greater mechanical stress, trauma, dislocation and infection than other vertebrae. Infections and dislocation of the vertebra at this position can lead to decreased mobility and paralysis.\n\nScan to access supplementary materials\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of the carcass after removing breast plate and organs to expose the spine, used to inspect for lesions and assess rib spacing.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of the carcass after removing breast plate and organs to expose the spine, used to inspect for lesions and assess rib spacing.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram showing the spinal cord and vertebrae.)\nVertebrae Spinal cord Free thoracic vertebra\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Diagram illustrating the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (fused).)\nThoracic vertebrae (fused) Free thoracic vertebra (articulation point) Lumbar vertebrae (fused)\n\n# Concluding the Post-Mortem: Checklist\n",
