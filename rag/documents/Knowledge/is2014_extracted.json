  "text": "# **Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Biosecurity Checklist**\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus is causing much concern across the U.S. poultry industry. All segments of the commercial poultry industry must have in place and continually follow comprehensive, stringent biosecurity practices. Biosecurity practices will significantly help prevent, mitigate, contain, and eradicate the HPAI virus. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has created a list of biosecurity measures to protect commercial and backyard flocks:\n\n## Premises\n\nDevelop and follow a premise-specific, comprehen-sive biosecurity plan. Share details with all employ-ees.\nPost signs warning individuals not to enter the farm or any of its buildings because of disease control status (No Admittance, Restricted Area, Biosecurity Zone).\nKeep poultry under roof and house doors locked at all times.\nHave an effective rodent control program for all buildings on the farm.\nSecure poultry houses against wild or free-flying birds, including those nesting in eaves.\nKeep poultry houses secure from wildlife, such as skunks and opossums. Remove if they gain en-trance.\nAvoid backyard birds if you are a commercial pro-ducer or employee.\nKeep pets away from chicken houses, egg rooms, and egg processing areas.\nKeep feed bins in good shape and secured at all times to prevent contamination by wild birds or rodents. Clean up spilled feed promptly.\nMake sure wild birds or rodents cannot access wa-ter supplies for drinkers and cool cells.\n\n## Equipment\n\nMake footbaths, site-provided footwear/boot cov-ers, hairnets, and disposable coveralls available out-side poultry houses. Change footbaths frequently.\nHave hand-washing/sanitizing stations available at each poultry house entrance.\nAvoid borrowing or sharing tools and equipment with neighbors. Clean and disinfect any off-farm tools or equipment before use and again before leaving the farm.\nClean and disinfect chicken transport equipment (carts, loaders, ramps) before use unless removing all poultry from the premises.\nOnly allow clean, sanitized, and disinfected plastic egg flats or new disposable egg flats on the egg-laying premises.\nProtect cleaned and disinfected equipment from exposure to wild birds.\nDisinfect anything rolled into poultry houses while animals are present. Disinfect surfaces contacting the ground.\n\n## Personnel\n\nRequire everyone to clean and disinfect footwear or wear site-provided footwear or covers before enter-ing chicken houses, processing areas, and office areas.\nRequire everyone to wash/sanitize their hands be-fore entering and after leaving poultry houses and processing areas.\nTrain all employees on biosecurity when hired, and annually after that. Keep biosecurity training records up to date.\nAvoid backyard or other birds—including pet birds, domestic chickens, fighting chickens, ducks, geese, waterfowl, guineas, exotic birds, quail, par-tridge, or pheasants, if raising commercial poultry.\nComply with a 3-day waiting period before entry to any portion of the farm if contact is made with other birds.\nAvoid exposure to borrowed off-farm equipment that has not been washed/disinfected.\nAvoid visiting rendering plants. Anyone visiting a rendering plant must shower and change clothes before entering the farm or any of its buildings un-less the flock is leaving the premises.\nDo not allow spent hen removal crews access to other chicken houses or egg processing areas.\n\n## Visitors\n\nDo not let visitors enter the farm or chicken houses unless absolutely necessary.\nKeep a visitors logbook that records (1) visitor's name, (2) company affiliation, (3) time of entry, (4) statement confirming no contact with other birds or poultry during the preceding 3 days, (5) departure time, and (6) contact telephone number.\nWear disposable coveralls/shoe covers/hairnets before entering barns, egg processing areas, or other work areas.\n\n## Vehicles\n\nClean and disinfect all vehicles that have traveled to at-risk locations-poultry supply store, co-op, feed store, café, and so forth. This includes disinfec- tion of the tires and undercarriage.\nDisinfect tires and undercarriage at the farm en- trance after leaving the main road.\nAvoid going from one poultry farm to another while birds are on the farm. If required, wash litter trucks and cleanout equipment with soap and wa- ter and disinfect before arrival at the next farm.\n\n## Wildlife\n\nRemove standing water—grade roads and fill mud holes. Maintain proper grade and slope to ditches that carry water away from poultry houses. Use culverts if necessary.\nManage risks at ponds and basins properly. Do not use untreated surface water as a water source for poultry or for washing down/cleaning.\nMinimize food sources. Do not feed wildlife. Man- age wildlife feed, such as grass seeds and insects. Mow frequently, and do not store litter outside near poultry houses.\nCover waste at all times. Securely close trash can lids. Cover birds in composter to prevent scaven- gers from removing mortality losses.\nRemove perches/nesting sites around houses, and plug all holes. Inspect foam insulation for rodent and bird damage. Note that it is unlawful to re- move nests with eggs or young in them at any time of year.\nMove decoys and scare devices (if used) frequently to improve effectiveness.\nAvoid lethal removal of wild birds to prevent the spread of HPAI. Because of the high number and constant movement of wild birds, the use of lethal methods is neither practical nor environmentally sound.\nThese steps will help ensure the health and safety of Mississippi poultry flocks and the multi-billion dol- lar Mississippi poultry industry. Normal daily mortal- ity should not be reported because this will only slow officials in trying to determine the actual disease status. However, a drastic change in flock health status or sud- den large increase in mortality should be reported.\n\n**Commercial producers should contact their service technicians for guidance and assistance at the first sign of a potential disease issue.**\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Logos of Mississippi Board of Animal Health and Mississippi State University Extension)\nThis material may be copied and distributed as needed as long as the content is not modified.\n\nThe information given here is for educational purposes only.
