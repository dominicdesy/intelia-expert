    Effects of Heat Stress on Broiler Performance and Welfare

    Heat stress is a major challenge in modern poultry production, particularly
    affecting broiler chickens. This study evaluated the impact of chronic heat
    stress (32°C vs 24°C) on Ross 308 broilers aged 21-42 days.

    Materials and Methods

    A total of 480 one-day-old Ross 308 male broilers were randomly allocated
    to two treatment groups. The control group was maintained at 24°C, while
    the heat stress group was exposed to 32°C from day 21 onwards. Body weight,
    feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were measured weekly.

    Results

    Heat stress significantly reduced average daily gain (ADG) by 18% (P<0.001).
    Feed intake decreased by 12% in heat-stressed birds compared to controls
    (P<0.01). FCR was negatively affected, increasing from 1.68 to 1.89 under
    heat stress conditions (P<0.001).

    Mortality rates were higher in the heat stress group (5.2% vs 2.1%, P<0.05).
    Carcass yield was reduced by 3.4% in heat-stressed birds (P<0.01).

    Discussion

    The observed reduction in performance parameters is consistent with previous
    studies on heat stress in broilers. The decreased feed intake is a primary
    adaptive response to reduce metabolic heat production. However, this leads
    to reduced nutrient intake and subsequent growth depression.

    Physiological mechanisms include increased respiration rate, elevated
    corticosterone levels, and oxidative stress. These factors collectively
    impair protein synthesis and increase protein degradation, resulting in
    reduced muscle growth.

    Conclusion

    Chronic heat stress substantially impairs broiler performance, welfare,
    and economic returns. Mitigation strategies such as improved ventilation,
    dietary modifications, and genetic selection for heat tolerance should be
    implemented in commercial production systems.

        Coccidiosis remains one of the most economically important diseases in
        poultry production worldwide. This review examines current prevention
        strategies including vaccination, anticoccidial drugs, and management
        practices. We analyzed 127 peer-reviewed studies published between 2015-2024
        to provide evidence-based recommendations for commercial broiler farms.

        Vaccination with live attenuated or recombinant vaccines showed 89% efficacy
        in reducing oocyst shedding. Rotation of ionophore and chemical anticoccidials
        maintained drug sensitivity. Improved litter management and biosecurity
        significantly reduced coccidiosis incidence by 34%.

        Economic analysis revealed that integrated prevention programs combining
        vaccination, strategic drug use, and management optimization provided the
        best return on investment, reducing mortality by 2.3% and improving FCR
        by 4 points.
