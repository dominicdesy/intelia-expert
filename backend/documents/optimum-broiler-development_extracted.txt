## **Introduction**

It is crucial for broiler performance to ensure a proper development of the chick (incubation + first 10 days of grow-out) especially because the chick does not have the ability to properly control its body temperature ('Cold Blooded') during this period.

Winter temperatures pose an additional challenge to the development of chick and the subsequent adult broiler. This is mainly due to poor temperature control and also to compromised ventilation in the broiler houses. Good stockmen have the responsibility to maintain a good environment for the chick to maximize the birds' genetic potential.

## Objectives

Review all the management aspects, in a check list form, that will help maintain broiler performance from the hatchery to the broiler house.
Define a few practical measurements that will indicate a successful incubation/brooding and a well developed broiler:
Chick quality measurements
Chick check
7-day mortalities
7-day weights

## 1.1. Why focus on incubation?

• Today's meat yield birds can produce higher embryonic temperatures and the risk of embryos overheating is higher. Research trials have shown that adverse incubation conditions can affect performance at different stages of the broiler cycle.

• Hatchery ventilation and incubation temperatures must be able to cope with this or serious damage can be done to the chicks.

• Less active, weaker chicks will show poorer starts and final performance. This will be especially true if brooding/growing conditions are challenging (winter).

## 1.2. How to establish good chick quality?

Traditional chick grading standards (right), are done visually and damage done to the chicks from overheating are not obvious to select out by grading operatives.
Research from Wineland and Hulet indicate that overheated chicks can show the following symptoms:
Weakness, tiredness
Will be smaller (shorter)
Dehydration
Smaller hearts, digestive system and less developed immune systems
More prone to bacterial infections (E.Coli)
More leg problems

## 1.21. How to establish good chick quality? - Cleanliness of hatch debris

!\[Image description\](Cobb logo)
Excess meconium residues on egg shells is a good indication that chicks have hatched too early and stayed too long on the hatcher baskets.

!\[Image description\](Image of hatchery with a label that says 'Adequate')
!\[Image description\](Image of hatchery with a label that says 'Too dirty')
Another indicator of overheating or chicks being hatched for too long is:
leg veins visible/protruding (left).
if you crush empty eggshells in your hand, the shell separates completely from the membrane (right).

!\[Image description\](Two chicks, one standing and the other pecking the ground.)
Strong, alert chicks

!\[Image description\](Many chicks together.)
Weak chicks

!\[Image description\](A hand holding many chicks together.)
Chicks should be bright yellow. Overheated chicks have poorly absorbed yolk sacs and hence pigments and are whiter than normal. *Caution: Formaldehyde masks white chicks*
Chicks should stand up and be active. If placed on their backs they should turn themselves within 3 seconds.

## 1.23. How to establish good chick quality? - Feathering

Good feather development is synonymous of good chick development during
incubation (chicks must look fluffy!).
However, excess development of the wing feathers does indicate early hatching
(overheating) and excessive time in the hatcher baskets.

## 1.24. How to establish good chick quality? - Colibacillosis control

• This is the most common infectious disease of poultry and is world wide in incidence.

• Infection is via the oral route, via the shell membrane, yolk/navel, water and the incubation period is 3-5 days.

• Poor navel healing, mucosal damage due to viral infections and immunosuppressive challenges are pre-disposing factors to infections.

| Egg condition | Total bacteria | Coliforms | 14 day mortality |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Clean | 600 | 123 | 0.9 |
| Soiled | 20,000 | 904 | 2.3 |
| Dirty | 80,000 | 1,307 | 4.1 |

## Consequences of overheating embryos E. Coli susceptibility *(Trial Cobb Spain, 2011)*

It is not clear if overheated embryos are more sensitive because they spend longer in the hatchers (hatch early), but the % of E.Coli isolations seem to increase with:

Treatment is by antibiotic treatment and the type of product used depends on resistance of the bacteria isolated.
Contaminated hatch debris and chick fluff in the hatchery are major sources of bacterial infection.
Prevention includes good hygiene of hatching eggs and good hygiene in the hatchery.
Good hygiene on the farm at depletion is also important because the bacteria are readily killed by disinfection.
Water hygiene is also potentially important and chlorine at 3 ppm is a good option (water ph dependant (ph \<7)).
Fumigation in the hatchers with formalin has shown good results in reducing bacterial load.
| Duration | Solutions | Volume |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| From transfer to six hours before take off | Formalin can either be applied neat concentrate (36% - 38%) or diluted 1:1 with water (final formalin solution of 18 - 19%) | 60 ml of solution per m³ of hatcher space (2.03 oz per 35 ft³), in pans with surface area of 50 cm²/m³ (7.75 in² per 35.3 ft³). Volumes need to be adjusted for neat concentrate formalin. |

## 1.3. What to measure? - Embryo temperatures

• Embryo temperatures - can be measured accurately by taking egg shell temperatures, on fertile eggs at the egg's equator with a thermoscan thermometer between 16 and 18 days of incubation.

This will highlight how uniform the temperature is inside the incubator and locate any adverse 'hot' or 'cold' spots, as seen in the contour graph below.

Infertile eggs must not be measured as they have 0.5 -1.7°C (2 - 3° F) lower egg shell temperatures than fertile eggs.

| 37.8 - 38.1°C (100.0 - 100.6°F) | Optimum | Good hatch and chick quality |
| 38.1 - 39.2°C (100.6 - 102.6°F) | Too warm | Good hatch, poorer chick quality |
| 39.2 - 40.0°C (102.6 - 104.0°F) | Too hot | Poor hatch and chick quality |

## 1.3. What to measure? - Embryo temperatures

• Effect of incubation temperature on hatchability and chick quality can be seen in the graphs below.

Factors affecting uniformity of incubation temperatures: a. Incorrect ventilation - air volume supply, pressures, damper settings, exhaust ventilation, etc. b. Temperature calibrations c. Cooling problems - water flow rates, valves stuck open, water temperature (too hold/cold), scale in pipes, etc. d. Over/under utilization of setting capacities e. Physics of air movement/design by manufacturer f. Incorrect setting patterns g. Maintenance - poor door seals h. Maintenance - correct turning angle

## 1.31. What to measure? - Hatch window

Hatch Window Targets are for the chicks to hatch: Max. 25%, 24 hours prior to pull Max. 75%, 12 hours prior to pull These targets are more critical for chicks being transported over long distances or time delays from hatch to delivery.

## 1. Hatchery

## 1.31. What to measure? - Hatch window

The Hatch Window can influence - • chick weight • residual yolk % • chick length Chick weight is the most important criteria from this list as high embryo temperatures cause early hatching, more risk of dehydration and subsequently a correlation to higher early broiler mortality.

## 1.32. What to measure? - Chick yield %

Chick yield is expressed as chick weight as a percentage of the initial egg weight. The old rule of thumb was that chicks weighed approximately two thirds of egg weight or 67%.

With many incubators today, especially single stage machine, the damper is closed in the early days to aid uniformity of temperature and development of the chorioallantoic membranes. This restriction of ventilation can affect the moisture weight loss of the egg and impact this chick yield %.

Research trials have shown that chick yield % can correlate to broiler 7 day mortality and bodyweights, especially in anti-biotic free environments. Excess moisture/fluid accumulation can be more susceptible to bacterial infection, especially with any stress factors to the day-old chicks.

!\[Image description\](A picture showing moisture weight loss at 18 days of incubation)
Good Bad Ideal chick yield % should be 66 - 68%

## 1.33. What to measure? - Cloaca temperatures

Chick internal temperature should be maintained at 40.0 - 40.6°C (104-105.08°F). The temperature should be measured gently inside the cloaca.
Chicks lose 3 g (0.007 lb) of moisture from the feathers which act as a cooling mechanism.
Chick internal rectal temperature can be measured at take-off or in the chick holding room,
but only when the chicks are dry and internal body temperature is stabilized i.e. not directly after spray vaccination.

Chick internal temperature above 41°C (105.8°F) will lead to panting.
Chick internal temperature below 40.0°C (104°F) is too cold.

## 2.1. Chick holding

Ideally room temperatures should be maintained between 24 - 26°C (75.278.8°F) and RH 65%.
Pre-warm chick holding room up to temperature before take-off starts to prevent cold stress on chicks, especially in winter.
Ceiling paddle fans/punka fans should direct air towards the ceiling and not down on chicks to cause chill effects.
Blue lights or lower light intensity will reduce stress.
Stocking density in chick boxes minimum 21 cm² (3.255 in²) per chick.

## 3.1. Ventilation

You cannot properly ventilate or control temperature if the house is not sealed (has air leaks). Test the effectiveness of how well the house is sealed by closing all the inlets, then open a door slightly ajar or crack open an inlet with one fan with a capacity 18 CMH/sq m of floor area (CFM/ft²) running → should record a
pressure in excess of 37.5 pascals (.151 inches of water) at the inlet. If \< 25 pascals (.10 inches of water), it indicates that the house is poorly sealed.

Use plastic sheeting on outside and inside of doors to seal.

## 3.1. Ventilation

There must be no drafts (either warm/cold) at floor level for the first fourteen days of age at least - during this period a draft is any air movement that exceeds 0.3 m/sec (59.055 feet/minute) at floor level.
The table below indicates the parameters of these key areas to maintain good atmospheric conditions.

Minimum ventilation must never be sacrificed.

Minimum ventilation must be increased if CO2 levels exceed 3,000 ppm or oxygen levels less than 19.6%.

## 3.1. Ventilation

Minimum ventilation controls air quality via fans which must work on a timer and inlets controlled by pressure and both independent of temperature control. The minimum ventilation system operates any time the house temperature is at or below the house set point temperature.
The timer should provide a minimum air exchange value of 12.5% (1/8) of house volume. The minimum run time needs to be at least 60 seconds to ensure that the incoming cold, outside air has properly mixed and heated with the internal air before reaching chick level.
Inlets are vital in achieving good air volume and uniform air distribution.
The inlets should completely seal when closed.
The inlets should react to the fans and work on pressure, NOT on percentage of opening or temperature.
The inlet capacity should match the fan capacity at the fans working pressure based on the width of the house.
Automatic calculation of minimum ventilation requirements for your house can be made on our website www.cobb-vantress.com

## 3.2. Relative humidity

## Controlling relative humidity

The main aim of controlling relative humidity is maintaining dry friable litter.
Wet or capped litter will lead to increased carcass issues such as podo-dermatitis and hock burn and in extreme situations even breast blisters.
Carcass downgrades is also used as a measurement of bird welfare. Failure to meet minimum requirements will lead to reduced stocking density that is permitted.
Moisture is produced by the heating system, drinking system and the birds.
To control relative humidity the only option is to increase the air temperature approximately for every 1°C (1.8°F) we heat the air the relative humidity of the air is reduced by 5%.
Warm air is lighter than cold air and the warmest air in the building is closest to the ceiling.
The longer we can keep the outside cold air close to the ceiling the better the opportunity of increasing the temperature of that air and therefore reducing its relative humidity.
The lower the relative humidity of the air at any temperature the larger the potential of that air to carry (soak up) moisture from the environment.
70 - 75% of the water consumed by the bird will be excreted to the air or the litter. It is the job of the ventilation system to remove and prevent a moisture build up in the house.

## 3. Brooding

## 3.2. Relative humidity

How to keep floors dry

Reduce relative humidity!
1°C (1.8°F) increase in air temperature = 5% RH reduction.
Heated air expands and holds more moisture.
The more we warm the incoming air from its outside temperature the bigger the moisture holding capacity of the air increases.
The best results from reducing air relative humidity are when there is a big difference between inside and out temperature.
Better reduction in relative humidity - winter time, during brooding.
Less effective reduction in relative humidity - summer time, when the birds are older and in warm climates.

## 3.3. Temperature

Often concrete/litter temperature is measured quickly at chick placement in a few random areas and not a true picture is taken of how uniform litter concrete/ litter temperature actually is. The best way to measure is to take a reading (both concrete/litter) every six meters in length of the poultry house and in three rows across the width of the house.

The minimum temperature for the first 14 days should not fall more than 1°C (1.8°F) below the set point.
Ensure heaters have been serviced.
Calibrate sensors before placement.
Ensure you have adequate heating capacity.
Radiant heating- ensure the correct number of chicks per heater.
Forced air heating - where winter outside minimum temperatures are above 0°C at least 0.07 kw/hour per cubic meter of house volume is required, and where the outside temperature is below zero, 0.10 kw/hour per cubic meter of house volume heating capacity.
Install back up thermometers to confirm environment.
Place sensors at bird height.
Chicks from pre-peak breeder flocks are smaller and have a higher need for external heat to maintain their optimal body temperature compared to larger chicks. Smaller chicks have increased surface to body weight ratio and therefore body heat loss is greater than larger chicks.

Paper used should be news type paper and not
tissue paper to ensure adequate time for feeding
before the paper breaks down.
Feed amount on paper at placement (one
application), minimum 70 g (0.15 lb) per chick.
A line of paper should be placed at each side of
each drinker line used in the house.
The automatic feeding system should be placed
on the concrete floor or down in the litter to
make access to the feeding system as easy as
possible for the chicks.
The feeding system should be set on overflow/
have pans flooded for chick placement (if possible).
On each entry to the house during brooding the
feed lines should be manually run to stimulate
feed intake.

## 3.5. Water

• Water spillage and wastage should be kept to a minimum especially in winter time because of lower air exchange during these months.

• Ideally at placement a bead of water should be visible on the end of the nipple to encourage water consumption-this is achieved by setting the pressure low in the drinking system. After the first hours and once you are sure that water consumption has been adequately achieved in the flock, turn the pressure setting in the drinking system up to prevent spillage and wet litter.

• Chicks should not be encouraged to drink from the drip trays after the first day of placement - water easily becomes contaminated from the environment and wasted onto the litter.

• Water consumption of 1 ml/bird (3.4 oz/100 chicks) per hour for the first twenty four hours after placement - minimum.

• Maintain litter moisture between 25-35% under the drinking system, reduce pressure if litter becomes damp.

• Place drinker lines at a height that the birds have to stretch slightly to reach.

• Ideal water temperature is between 10-14°C (50-57°F), however birds can tolerate a wide range of water temperature; even so water temperature should never be allowed to be less than 5°C (41°F) or greater than 25°C (77°F). If this occurs the drinking system must be flushed.

## 3.51. Water - Flow rate

Also we need to have sufficient flow rate from the nipple to aid water intake and therefore feed intake in the first week.
In fact chicks consume nearly three times the volume of water as feed during this period.
At day old a chick can apply a pressure of 3 g (0.007 lb) to the nipple so they can only activate the nipple from the side, at 9 10 days of age a chick can apply a pressure of 7 - 10 g (0.015 - 0.022 lb) so they can activate the nipple from the bottom.

## 3. Brooding

## 3.7. Chick check

The main objective of management during the first hours after placement on the farm is to achieve as much intake of both feed and water in as many chicks as possible. Failure to achieve this objective will lead to irreversible compromised flock performance and will express itself as poor growth, poor feed conversion and poor flock uniformity.

An excellent indicator of floor temperature is the temperature of the chick's feet.
If the chick's feet are cold, the internal body temperature of the chick is also reduced.
Cold chicks will be seen huddling with reduced activity and resulting in reduced feed and water intake and therefore reduced growth rate.
By placing the feet against your neck or cheek one can readily learn how warm or cold the chick is.
If they are comfortably warm, the chicks should be evenly and actively moving around the brooding area.
If the crops of the chicks are checked eight hours after placement a minimum of 85% of examined chicks should have both feed and water present.
A minimum of 95% of the bird's crops should be filled upon examination the morning after placement.
Sample 100 chicks per brood area.
Check: temperature of feet against neck or cheek.
If the feet are cold, re-evaluate pre-heating temperature.
Evaluate crop fill and indicate results on form as below:

## 4. Ultimate performance indicators

## 4.1. 7-day mortality/weights

Mortality percentage is a good indicator of chick quality, hatching process, house set up and early brooding management.
Maximum seven day mortality should not exceed 1% cumulative.
Measuring seven-day weights will give an indication of how successful the brooding management has been.
Failure to achieve good seven-day weights will mean an inferior result at the end of the growing cycle.
For every gram at day 7 we should target an increase to 11.8 g (0.03 lb) at 35 days.

A single, small chick is prominently positioned in the lower center of the frame, facing towards the right, while several other chicks are visible in the midground. In the background, there are rows of feeders or water lines supported by dark metal structures. A few human figures are seen standing in the distance, under the dimly lit interior, which is framed by the industrial ceiling structure of the building.)
