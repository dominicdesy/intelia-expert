Water system and water source variability can create cleaning challenges; the following information is a guideline to ensure optimal drinking water supply.\n\nThe elements of Drinking Water Management Practices as they apply to a poultry house include:\n\nAnnual water analysis.\nWater line sanitation, biofilm purge prior to bird placement.

Refer to Table 6 for daily water consumption guide. Flush lines weekly at high pressure. Check water filters weekly, replace regularly. |\n| Nipple Drinkers | Recommended 8-12 birds/nipple. It is recommended that nipple flow be set at 25 ml/minute. Maintain water pressure per manufacturers recommendations. Lines must be level with no air blocks. Monitor and adjust height daily - at chicks' eye level for the first two days; at a 45 degree angle starting at day 3; then, gradually raise lines so that the birds drink straight up by day 10. |\n| Bell Drinkers | Recommended 10-12 bell drinkers/1000 birds with a water depth of 1.9 cm (0.75 inches). Monitor and adjust drinker height daily - up to seven days of age, the top lid of the automatic drinker should be set at the height of the average birds back; then, the drinkers should be raised to a level where the bottom of the drinker is even with the average birds back. |\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Platinum Brooding logo)\n\n## Drinking Water Management\n\n## Disinfection of Wells\n\nIt is important that all wells are periodically disinfected with chlorine to ensure they are free from bacterial contamination. Test for bacteria frequently (at least twice per year), and treat again as necessary.\n\nThe method outlined below describes a general procedure to disinfect a well. If you have any questions about this procedure, contact your local environmental health officer for advice.\n\n## Procedure\n\nPour unscented household bleach (5-6% chlorine) directly into the well. The chart below outlines the amount of chlorine to add based on the diameter fo the well of pipe and the depth of the water in the well or pipe.\nHelp the chlorine mix by running a hose back into the well for 30 minutes. Run each tap (including outside house bibs) until you can smell chlorine.\nOpen the valve or plug at the top of the pressure tank to allow the solution to contact the entire inside sur- face of the tank, then close the valve or plug.\nLeave the chlorinated water in the system for 24 hours. This is a very strong chlorine solution (50\n| Diameter of Well, or Pipe | | Bleach (5-6% Chlorine) per Depth of water in Well or Pipe |\n| ------------------------- | - | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Inches | Cm | Per 10 Feet | Per 3 M |\n| 2 | 5 | 1 tsp | 5 mL |\n| 4 | 10 | 4 tsp | 20 mL |\n| 6 | 15 | 10 tsp | 50 mL |\n| 8 | 20 | 7 Tbsp | 100 mL |\n| 10 | 25 | 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp | 150 mL |\n| 12 | 30 | 3/4 cup + 1 Tbsp | 200 mL |\n| 24 | 60 | 3 1/2 cups | 800 mL |\n| 36 | 90 | 2 quarts | 2.3L |\n| 48 | 120 | 3 quarts | 3.4L |\n| 60 | 150 | 5 quarts | 5.7L |\n| 72 | 180 | 7 quarts | 8L |\n| 96 | 240 | 3 gallons | 13.6L |\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Logo of Platinum Brooding)\n\n## Drinking Water Management\n\n## Chemical Analysis - Water Quality Standards for Poultry\n\n| Microbiological Analysis | Units | Result | Health Canada Guidelines⁴ | Level Considered Average (S.E.Watkins, Ph.D)² | MAC (Maximum Acceptable Concentration) |\n| ------------------------ | ----- | ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| Total coliforms | CFU/mL | | 0/100mL | 0 | 50 cfu/ml |\n| E.coli | CFU/mL | | 0/100mL | 0 | \\<1 |\n| Heterotrophic Count | MPN/mL | | 500 cfu/ml | | 500 cfu/ml |\n\n| Physical Properties | Units | Result | Health Canada Guidelines | Level Considered Average (S.E.Watkins, PhD)² | MAC (Maximum Acceptable Concentration) (S.E.Watkins, PhD)² |\n| ------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Colour | Units | | | | 15 |\n| Turbidity | NTU | | 0.3/1.0/0.1 | | 5 |\n| Temperature | ºC | | n/a | n/a | n/a |\n\n| Routine Water Analysis | Units | Result | Health Canada Guidelines | Level Considered Average (S.E.Watkins, PhD)² | MAC (Maximum Acceptable Concentration) |\n| ---------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| pH | | | 6.5-8.5 | 6.8-7.5 | 6.0-8.0 |\n| Total hardness | ppm | | n/a \\* | 60-180 | 110 |\n| T-Alkalinity | Mg/L | | n/a | | 250-650 |\n| Total dissolved solids | Mg/L | | ≤ 500 | | 500 |\n| Sodium (Na) | Mg/L | | ≤ 200 | 32 | 50 |\n| Iron (Fe) | Mg/L | | ≤ 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.3 |\n| Magnesium (Mg) | Mg/L | | n/a \\* | 14 | 125 |\n| Manganese | | | ≤ 0.05 | | |\n| Calcium (Ca) | Mg/L | | n/a \\* | 60 | |\n| Chloride (Cl) | | | ≤ 250 | 14 | 250 |\n| Fluoride | | | 1.5 | | |\n| Nitrate | Mg/L | | 45 | 10 | 25 |\n| Nitrite | Mg/L | | n/a | | |\n\n## Integrated Poultry Health Management\n\n## Drinking Water Management\n\n| Metals Extractable | Units | Result | Health Canada Guidelines | Level Considered Average (S.E.Watkins, PhD)² | MAC (Maximum Acceptable Concentration) |\n| ------------------ | ----- | ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| Aluminum | Mg/L | | 0.1/0.2° | | 0.1 |\n| Antimony | Mg/L | | 0.006 | | 0.006 |\n| \\*\\*Arsenic\\*\\* | Mg/L | | 0.005 | | 0.01 |\n| \\*\\*Barium\\*\\* | Mg/L | | 1 | | 1 |\n| \\*\\*Boron\\*\\* | Mg/L | | 5 | | 5 |\n| \\*\\*Cadmium\\*\\* | Mg/L | | 0.005 | | 0.005 |\n| Chromium | Mg/L | | 0.05 | | 0.05 |\n| Copper (Cu) | Mg/L | | ≤ 1.0 | 0.002 | 0.6 |\n| Lead (Pb) | Mg/L | | 0.01 | 0 | 0.02 |\n| Uranium | Mg/L | | 0.02 | | 0.02 |\n| Zinc | Mg/L | | ≤ 5.0 | | 1.5 |\n\n| Oxidiza- tion Test | Units | Result | Health Canada Guidelines | Level Considered Average (S.E.Watkins, PhD)² | MAC (Maximum Acceptable Concentration) |\n| ------------------ | ----- | ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n\nNote - n/a \\* values = Public acceptance of hardness varies considerably.
