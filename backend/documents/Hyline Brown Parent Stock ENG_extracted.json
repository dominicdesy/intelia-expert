Chicks require immediate and easy access to water.\nDo not beak-trim sick or stressed birds.\nDo not hurry; handle chicks carefully to prevent errors and poor uniformity.\nProvide vitamins and electrolytes containing vitamin K in drinking water 2 days before and 2 days after beak trimming.\nWatch chicks after beak trimming to assess stress. Control the ambient temperature until birds appear comfortable and active.\nKeep feed at the highest level for several days after beak trimming.\nUse only well-trained crews.\nUse 360° activated nipples, supplemental chick drinkers and splash cups to encourage drinking. Lower the pressure to make it easy for the chicks to drink.\n\n## Floor Systems Management\n\n## REARING PERIOD\n\nIf rearing and laying are to be done in separate houses, use similiar feed and water systems.\nFrom an early age, accustom birds to humans by frequently walking through the house.\nRearing house should have elevated bird platforms with feed and water stations.\nRearing house should have perches.\nSolid perches above water and feed lines are preferred.\nFlocks housed in all-slat houses during lay should also be grown on slat or wire floors.\nSchedule feed lines to run as soon as birds are awake and again after most eggs have been laid.\n0-14 day mortality is typically \\< 2%.\nDuring rearing and laying, if mortality exceeds 0.1%/ week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.\nRemove mortality daily and dispose of properly.\n\n## TRANSFER\n\nThe flock can be moved into the laying facility at 15–17 weeks of age.\nComplete the vaccination program prior to transfer.\nLight hours and light intensity of rearing and laying houses should be matched at transfer.\nLight intensity should increase weekly for 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the layer house.\nPlace females on slats when placing birds in the laying house.\nReduce transfer stress by using water-soluble vitamins, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and probiotics in drinking water 3 days before and 3 days after transfer.\nHouse males in laying facilities before or at the same time as females. (Hy-Line Brown males may be moved a few days earlier to laying house to give them time to acclimate to new environment before arrival of females.)\nEstablish the correct male to female ratios.\nCheck every bird and verify correct identification. Check feather color and dubbing in male lines.\n\n## NEST TRAINING\n\nNest boxes can be placed in the house after brooding and can be parallel or perpendicular to the wall.\nFeed lines should not be directly in front of nests.\nStarting the day of transfer, open some nest box curtains to encourage nest exploration.\nTrain females to use nests by frequent morning walks (3–4 times/day) through the house for 8 weeks after birds are moved to the production house.\nWhile walking, move birds away from resting areas, out of corners, away from walls and toward nests.\nAutomatic nests should open two hours before lights- on and close two hours before lights start to dim.\nIf using string lights inside the nest, turn on 1 hour before house lights are turned on to attract females. Turn nest lights off 1 hour after house lights come on.\nDiscontinue nest light usage after 26 weeks of age.\nDuring the first week of laying, leave a few eggs in the nest to encourage females to use nests.\nEliminate dark areas in the laying house to discourage floor eggs.\nIf local regulations allow, electric deterrent wires can be used to keep birds away from the walls and corners to control floor eggs.\nQuickly remove floor eggs.\nBe sure all floor eggs are removed before lights go out at night.\nClose nests at night.\nKeep litter levels to a minimum during the nest training period. Litter deeper than 10 cm results in increased floor eggs and broodiness.\n\n## Nests\n\nNests should be dark, secluded, warm, and free of air drafts.\nNests should have a well-lit staging area at the entrance to allow for examination and easy access by females.\nAvoid barriers to nests, such as drinker lines positioned too low or swinging.\n\n## ASSESSING PULLET QUALITY\n\nCheck the physical condition of each bird.

Birds able to jump will have better nesting behaviour and be more mobile in multi-tier aviary systems.\nPerches reduce social stress by providing safe resting sites.\nPerches increase living space in the facility.\nPerches allow birds to roost at night.\nUse of perches may reduce piling behavior in flocks.\n\n## Perch Design\n\nFloor-reared birds should have access to perches and slats no later than 10 days of age.\nPerch height should not exceed 1 m to avoid injuries.\nProvide 10–15 cm perch space per bird (check local regulations concerning perch space).\n!\\[Image description\\](A-frame perch design with measurements)\nWater line perch Perch over feeder\n\nSeparate perch rails by at least 30 cm to prevent cannibalistic pecking of birds on adjacent rails.\nPlace perches on slats to maintain good litter conditions and control floor eggs.\nAvoid slippery perches.\nPerches should support the bottom of the foot and be comfortable for the bird.\nIf possible, use the same perch style in rear and lay facilities.\nDo not use perches above water lines during rear if using an electric deterrent over the water line during production.\nPerches should be easy to clean and disinfect between flocks.\nSeal cracks, crevices, and open ends of pipes to reduce hiding areas for red mites (*Dermanyssus gallinae*).\nPerches are ideally placed over feed lines and on the top level in aviaries.\n!\\[Image description\\](Perch in aviary system)\n!\\[Image description\\](Elevated platform)\n!\\[Image description\\](Perch on slats)\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Hy-Line Brown Male Management\n\nThe Hy-Line Brown male's 18-week body weight is 2.14–2.31 kg.\nThe Hy-Line Brown male's adult body weight is 2.64–2.87 kg (40 weeks of age).\nThe Hy-Line Brown male should preferably not be beak trimmed. If treatment is required, beak treat in hatchery or tip at 7–10 days of age.\nAchieving male target body weights during rear is critical for optimum mating behavior and fertility.\nMales and females should receive the same feed and lighting schedule.\nFor breeder cages having a specific male feeder space, these spaces should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.\nMale and female breeders should reach sexual maturity at approximately the same time.\nFrom 0–4 weeks, rear males separately to improve male body weight gain.\n!\\[Image description\\](Red vent is indicative of a working Hy-Line Brown male.)\nAt 5 weeks, mix males and females. In cages, mix 3–4 females into each male cage. If males appear weaker than females, mix males with females at a 1:1 ratio through the growing period.\nGrading males into pens based on body weight can improve male uniformity.\nMales and females must be co-mingled during the rearing period to become socialized and avoid mating problems as adults.\nKeep extra males in a separate pen; do not mix extra males with females.\nContinue culling males as needed during production.\nMaintain a mating ratio of 8 males for every 100 females throughout production in floor and cage systems.\nToo many males results in more fighting, less mating activity, disruption of social groups and lower fertility.\n\n## MALE EVALUATION – A BEAUTY CONTEST\n\n*Tall, masculine appearance with full red comb* Evaluate males at 10 weeks and at transfer.\n\nCull roosters with:\n\nLameness\nMore than 200 g below target body weight\nCurled toes\nFoot pad lesions\nPoor feathering\nPoor beaks\nLow social ranking\nHide in nests\nFeather pecked\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Artificial Insemination\n\nArtificial insemination can be used for PS in cage housing systems. Roosters and hens are typically housed separately in 1–2 bird cages. Use experienced personnel for semen collection and hen insemination to avoid injury and bird stress.\n\n## Semen Collection from Roosters\n\nOne rooster's semen is used for approximately 10 hens.\nDo not collect semen from the same rooster more than 2 times per week. Never collect from the same rooster on consecutive days.\nSemen without semen extender can be used up to 30 minutes from the first male collected; semen with extender can be refrigerated up to 4 hours.\nSemen collection is a two-person operation. To collect semen, hold both legs and position the male with the tail facing the person drawing the semen. Gently massage the male's back (lumbar area) in a downward motion starting at the ribcage and ending at the starting part of the tail.\n\n## Insemination of the Hen\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Semen collection)\nArtificial insemination should begin after a majority (70 to 80%) of the eggs are laid.\nAmount of semen to use is 5ml of semen per 125 females, regardless if extender is used. This equals 40 µL semen volume per female.\nThe insemination procedure is a two-person operation.\nUse good quality disposable plastic straws (70 mm) for insemination. Do not attempt to clean and reuse insemination straws.\nTrim the feathers around the vent area.\nThe bird handler should gently remove the hen from the cage and, using thumb and forefinger, spread apart the cloaca, resulting in the turning of the cloaca inside out (everting the oviduct).\nThe inseminator using an automatic pipette fills the straw with 40 µL of semen and inserts the insemination straw into the exposed (everted) opening to the oviduct to inseminate the hen.\n!\\[Image description\\](Insemination of hen)\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Good Lighting Practices\n\nIn cage housing, measure minimum light intensity at feeder on bottom tier cages, mid-way between lights.\nIn floor housing, measure minimum light intensity at level of bird's head.\nKeep light bulbs and bulb covers clean to prevent loss of light intensity.\nPrevent dark areas caused by too much distance between lights or burned out light bulbs.\nShiny or white surfaces reflect light and increase light intensity.\nTake local conditions into account which may require adaptations of lighting programs.\nLight hours of rearing and production houses should be matched at transfer.\nLight intensity should increase 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house (but not prior to 14 weeks of age). Final rearing house light intensity should match the laying house intensity.\nLight stimulation period should extend into peaking period (achieve 16 hours of light at about 25 weeks).\n\n## Light Program for Light-Controlled Housing\n\nHy-Line Brown breeders require a slower step-down of light hours from 0-9 weeks to prevent early sexual maturity and promote good body weight uniformity.\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Gradual light increases up to 25 weeks of age, 16 hour maximum | | |\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -------------------------------------------------------------- | - | - |\n| 24 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 24 |\n| 23 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 23 |\n| 22 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 22 |\n| 21 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 21 |\n| 20 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 20 |\n| 19 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 19 |\n| 18 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 18 |\n| 17 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 17 |\n| 16 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 16 |\n| TIME OF DAY | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 15 |\n| 15 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 14 |\n| 14 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 13 |\n| 13 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 12 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 22 | 20 | 18 | 16 | 14 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 12 | 12½ | 13 | 13½ | 14 | 14½ | 15 | 15½ | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 |\n| 21109876543210 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 | 32 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | Transfer flock to laying house | | | | | | | Light stimulation at ideal body weight (1.40 kg) and 85% uniformity | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| LIGHT INTENSITY AND SPECTRUM | WEEKS OF AGE | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 30-50 lux | | | | | | | | | | 10-15 lux blue-green (\\>3500 K) | | | | | | | | | | 20 lux | | | | | | | | | | 20-25 lux red-orange (\\<2700 K) | |\n\nLight-controlled houses are those which use light traps around fans and air inlets and complete prevent the ingress of light from the outside. Houses that are not light controlled should use lighting programs for open- sided housing.\n\nAn intermittent lighting program for chicks is preferred. If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0-7 days, then use 22 hours of light from 0-3 days and 21 hours of light from 4-7 days.\n\"Lights on\" time can be varied between houses in laying flocks to facilitate egg collection on multiple flock complexes.\nIf the laying flock has a large spread in hatch ages and/or poor uniformity, light stimulate the flock based on the youngest hatch date or lightest birds.\nUse cool lights (\\>3500 K) in rearing facility to ensure sufficient blue-green spectrum.\nUse warm lights (\\<2700 K) in laying flocks to ensure sufficient red spectrum light.\nFor more information on poultry lighting, see \\[Understanding Poultry Lighting\\](Understanding Poultry Lighting) and \\[Impact of Tarp Color on Poultry Lighting\\](Impact of Tarp Color on Poultry Lighting).\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Customized Lighting Programs for Open-Sided Housing (www.hyline.com)\n\nThe Hy-Line International Lighting Program can create custom lighting programs for your location.

Allow one additional hour of incubation for every day beyond 10 days of egg age.\nChick weight at hatch is directly related to the weight of the hatching egg, usually 66% of egg weight.\nEggs should be grouped in setter according to parent source flock. Maintain these groups so similar size chicks may be placed together in the brooder house.\n!\\[Image description\\](A photo of several newly hatched chicks being held in a person's hands.

Inside\nchick boxes, 30-32°C and 50% relative humidity\nshould be maintained.\nFor transporting HE, the transporter should maintain\nan environmental temperature of 15-18°C.\nPrecondition the transporter to set the proper\ntemperature for at least 30 minutes before loading.\n!\\[Image description\\](Hatching egg pallet ready for transportation)\n!\\[Image description\\](Shipping pallets are constructed of preformed spacers that provide strength and airspace around chick boxes.)\nClean and disinfect the transporter between deliveries with verification of cleaniness\nby negative laboratory results.\nUtilize global positioning system (GPS) monitoring of truck location along the route.\n\n## Transportation of Hatching Eggs (HE)\n\nPackaging materials for boxes and shipment\npallets must be clean, dry, unused and properly\nstored.\nAlways place HE boxes on a pallet during\nstorage, never directly on the floor.\nDo not tip hatching egg boxes at any time\nduring packing and transportation.\nHE boxes should be placed on the shipment\npallet in an alternating pattern for stability. Do\nnot stack HE boxes more than five high.\nThe HE shipment pallet should be shrink\nwrapped and cargo netted for maximum\nstability.\nTemperature and humidity recorders are\nplaced in selected HE boxes to monitor\nconditions during transportation.\n!\\[Image description\\](Proper pallet design)\n!\\[Image description\\](Chick box label)\n\n## Transportation of Day-Old Chicks (DOC)\n\nDOC are placed in chick boxes in the hatchery after chick processing.\n!\\[Image description\\](Chick box temperature recorders)\nDOC boxes should be placed on a clean, dry pallet and secured with spacers to provide stability and spaces\nfor ventilation.\nArrange spacers between chick boxes to ensure adequate air flow. DOC boxes and spacers should be\narranged on the pallet so that each DOC box has at least one side open to a larger airspace.\nTemperature and humidity recorders are placed in selected chick boxes to monitor conditions during\ntransportation and chick placement onto the brooding facility. Return temperature recorders to Hy-Line\nInternational promptly for evaluation.\nFor more information on HE and DOC transportation and pallet contruction, see https://www.uspoultry.org/ communications/AirCargo/24/index.html.\n\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Feed Biosecurity\n\nNo animal sourced feed ingredients should be used in a PS flock due to the risk of pathogen contamination.\nUse only ingredients from an approved supplier list, ensuring that the suppliers have an adequate program to control contamination and potential risks.\nMaintain a strict policy for visitors to the feed mill following a downtime period matrix between the feed mill and other production facilities.\nIntroduce a personnel hygiene and clothing policy, with frequent evaluation of its efficacy.\nKeep a periodic cleaning (with documentation) of all areas and equipment in the feed mill.\nTake periodic environmental swabs of the feedmill and test finished feed for coliforms and *Salmonella*.\nMaintain records of the results to establish baselines to identify trends and critical periods.\nKeep a clean and a dirty route inside the feed mill grounds.\nFeed ingredients and internal feed delivery trucks should never cross routes inside the feed mill.\nHeat treatment of finished feed (86°C for 6 minutes) with consecutive chemical and or additive treatment (organic acids, formaldehyde, terpenes, essential oils) is the best way to clean and control subsequent pathogen growth on feed.\nImplement a pest control program and maintain with periodic internal and external audits, monitoring of rodenticide bait activity and an action plan in case of deviation.\nBulk feed should be delivered in a clean transport; avoid bagged feed and ingredients as an efficient way to reduce pest infestation.\nAudit the feed mill periodically for cleanliness and quality.\n\n## Feed Management\n\nIdeally, each variety should receive its recommended feed formulation.\nIf two PS varieties are in the same house and it is only possible to have one feed for both, formulate the feed for the variety having the lowest feed intake.\nKeep feed retention samples in case an investigation of feed quality is needed.\nIf a pre-lay diet cannot be used due to multiple flock ages, a developer diet with a higher calcium amount (1.4%) should be used.\nCheck the consistency of the feed (particle size, excessive powder or moisture, presence of foreign material, odd coloring or smell) between batches and report any changes in the normal appearance to the feed mill.\nEnsure that the feed formulas are constantly updated by the attending nutritionist after review of flock production data.\nDefine acceptable deviations of actual from theoretical ingredient usage and have an action plan in place in case of significant deviation.\nKeep production records for a minimum period of one year to allow traceability.\nKeep an open channel of communication and a complaint form between farms and feed mill. Ensure that all the complaints are documented and verified.\nFor more information, see \\[Feed Granulometry\\](Feed Granulometry).\n\n## \\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Feed Particle Size\n\nA sieve shaker separates feed sample into categories based on particle size.\n\nUse on the farm to check feed particle size from the feed mill—sample taken on delivery or from feed bins.\nUse to assess the uniformity of feed particle size throughout the feeding system—samples are taken from various points.\n\n## Too many fine feed particles:\n\nFeed intake and nutrient absorption decreases\nDust in house increases\n\n## Too many coarse feed particles:\n\nBirds selectively eat large particles\nRisk of feed separation increases\n\n## Optimal Feed Particle Profile\n\n!\\[Image description\\](The image shows a Hy-Line Sieve Shaker, a device used to separate feed samples based on particle size.

Good quality water must be available to birds at all times.\nWater and feed consumption are directly related- when birds drink less, they consume less feed and production quickly declines.\nAs a general rule, healthy birds will consume 1.5– 2.0 times more water than feed. This ratio increases in high ambient temperatures.\nTest water quality at least 1 time per year. The water source will determine regularity of water testing.\nSurface water requires more frequent testing, as it is more affected by season and rainfall patterns.\nClosed wells taking water from aquifers or deep artesian basins will be more consistent in water quality, but are generally higher in dissolved mineral content.\nThe presence of coliform bacteria is an indicator that water source has been contaminated with animal or human waste.\nWhen collecting a well water sample, let water run for 2 minutes prior to collecting the sample. Water samples should be kept below 10°C and submitted to the lab in less than 24 hours.\nSome water sources contain high levels of dissolved minerals such as calcium, sodium and magnesium. When this occurs, amounts of these minerals in water have to be considered when formulating feed.\nIdeal water pH is 5–7 to promote good water sanitation, increase feed consumption and improve upper gastrointestinal health.\nLess than optimum water quality can have a significant impact on gut health which will lead to under utilization of nutrients in feed.\n| ITEM | MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION (ppm or mg/L)\\* | COMMENTS |\n| ---- | ------------------------------------ | -------- |\n| Nitrate NO3- 1 | 25 | Older birds will tolerate higher levels up to 20 ppm.

Do not feed Pre-Lay later than first egg as it contains insufficient calcium to support egg production. Implementing a pre-lay diet can be challenging in mixed-age flocks. If it's not possible to use the Pre-Lay diet, the calcium content of the last stage rearing diet (developer) must be increased to 1.4%.\n\n³ Recommended energy range is based on raw material energy values shown in feed ingredient table at back of this guide. It is important that target concentrations of dietary energy are adjusted according to energy system applied to raw material matrix.\n\n⁴ Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed.\n\n⁵ Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw materials used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only.\n\n⁶ Calcium should be supplied as fine calcium carbonate (mean particle size less than 2 mm). Coarse limestone (2–4 mm) can be introduced in Pre-Lay Diet at up to 50% of total limestone.\n\n⁷ Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.\n\n⁸ Oil levels can be increased to 2.0% in starter diets when given as a mash to control dust and increase feed palatability.\n\nAvoid excessive body weight gain after 12 weeks.\n\n\\<\\<

and/or energy may be changed to optimize egg size.\n\n3 Peaking nutrient levels are calculated for birds at peak egg production. Prior to achieving peak egg production, the nutrient requirements will be lower.\n\n4 A good approximation of the influence of temperature on energy needs is that for each 0.5°C change higher or lower than 22°C, subtract or add about 2 kcal /bird / day, respectively.\n\n5 Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed.\n\n* Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only.\n\n7 Calcium and available phosphorus requirements are determined by flock age. When production remains higher and diets are fed for longer than ages shown, it is recommended to increase to calcium and phosphorus concentrations of next feeding phase.\n\n• Calcium carbonate particle size recommendation varies throughout lay. Refer to Calcium Particle Size Table. Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility.\n\n9 Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.\n\n## \\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Feed Ingredient Tables\n\n| INGREDIENT (as-fed basis) | DRY MATTER (%) | CRUDE PROTEIN (%) | FAT-ether extract (%) | CRUDE FIBRE (%) | CALCIUM (%) | PHOSPHORUS total (%) | PHOSPHORUS available (%) | SODIUM (%) | CHLORIDE (%) | POTASSIUM (%) | SULPHUR (%) | ME (kcal/lb) | ME (kcal/kg) | CHOLINE (mg/kg) |\n| ------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------- |\n| Barley, grain | 89 | 11.5 | 1.9 | 5.0 | 0.08 | 0.42 | 0.15 | 0.03 | 0.14 | 0.56 | 0.15 | 1247 | 2750 | 1027 |\n| Beans, broad (Vicia faba) | 89 | 25.7 | 1.4 | 8.2 | 0.14 | 0.54 | 0.20 | 0.08 | 0.04 | 1.20 | n/a | 1098 | 2420 | 1670 |\n| Canola meal | 91 | 38.0 | 3.8 | 11.1 | 0.68 | 1.20 | 0.40 | | n/a | 1.29 | 1.00 | 957 | 2110 | 6700 |\n| Corn, yellow, grain | 88 | 7.9 | 3.5 | 1.8 | 0.02 | 0.24 | 0.07 | 0.02 | 0.04 | 0.31 | 0.08 | 1524 | 3360 | 1100 |\n| Corn gluten meal, 60% | 90 | 60.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 0.02 | 0.50 | 0.09 | 0.03 | 0.05 | 0.35 | 0.50 | 1681 | 3705 | 2200 |\n| Cottonseed meal, 41%, mech.

Parent stock must be kept in strictly biosecure locations. Biosecurity is the best method of avoiding diseases. Monitoring programs should be in place to confirm that the PS flock is free of all diseases under regulation by both the importing and exporting countries. All flocks should be free of important vertically transmitted diseases like *Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae,* salmonellas, lymphoid leucosis and others under regulation. Parent flocks receive regular veterinary inspections and confirmed free of clinical signs of disease.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Biosecurity Sign)\n\n## Facility Biosecurity *(All visitors should be verified as salmonella negative prior to entering the farm)*\n\n| TO/ FROM | PS Farms | Hatchery, Feed Mill |\n| -------- | -------- | ------------------- |\n| Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza areas or Exotic Newcastle affected areas | 7 nights | 7 nights |\n| Other Poultry Farms | 4 nights | 4 nights |\n| Industry Convention\\* (with other poultry farmers or international attendees) | 1 night | 1 night |\n| Lab Building, Office | Same Day\\*\\* | Same Day\\*\\* |\n| Salmonella Positive Locations | 3 nights | 3 nights |\n| PS Farms, Egg Transfer | Same Day\\*\\* | Same Day\\*\\* |\n| Hatchery, Feed Mill | 1 night | |\n\n\\*\\*MUST traffic from youngest to oldest flocks and/or healthy to sick flocks.

Feed should be augured from the delivery truck over the farm perimeter fence. Farm dedicated vehicles deliver feed to the PS house silos.\n\n## Dirty Road\n\nUse dirty road for manure, litter, dead birds, and moving out end-of-lay hens.\n\n## Feed\n\nUse good quality, tested feed ingredients.\nUse heat treatment (preferred) or chemical treatment of feed for control of *Salmonella* and coliform bacteria.\nDo not use animal source proteins.\nControl traffic and truck sanitation to mill.\n\n## Farm Construction\n\nUse smooth, impermeable materials whenever possible.\nBuild in drains for easy washing.\nUse gravel or concrete outside the buildings to help control rodents.\nHouses should be designed to prevent exposure to wild birds, insects and rodents.\n\n## Entry into Bird Area\n\nClean foot baths containing disinfectant should be placed outside entries to all poultry houses.\nA second change of footwear is required before entering the bird area.\nWorkers should be limited to a single house.\n\n## Farm Design\n\nA single-aged PS farm using an all-in, all-out principle is best to prevent transmission of disease.\nUse a perimeter fence around the farm to exclude livestock and traffic, and to mark the biosecure area of the farm.\nUse dedicated vehicles inside the clean area.\nUtilize deterrents to exclude wild birds.\nUse footbaths or shoe changes with Danish-style entry at each house.\n\n## Dead Bird Disposal\n\nQuickly and properly dispose of dead chickens daily.\nDispose of dead birds by rendering, incineration, or composting.\nFreeze dead birds if they will be disposed off-site.\n\n## Water\n\nEnsure good quality and sufficient quantity of water.\nTest twice annually.\nTreat water as necessary.\nSanitize water lines routinely.\nMaintain pH at appropriate levels.\n\n## Rodents\n\nRodents are known carriers of many poultry diseases and the most common reason for re- contamination of a cleaned and disinfected poultry facility. They are also responsible for house-to- house spread of disease on a farm.\nThe farm should be free of debris, tall grass and other places that could harbor rodents.\nThe perimeter of each house should have a 1 m wide area of crushed rock or concrete to prevent rodents from burrowing into the house.\nFeed and eggs should be stored in rodent-proof areas.\nBait stations should be placed around the perimeter of the house as well as throughout the house, and maintained with fresh rodenticide.\nFill all gaps in the entrances, walls and roof which could provide rodent access into the poultry house.\nFor more information, see \"Code of Practice for the Prevention of Rodent Infestation on Poultry Farms.\" \\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Vaccination Recommendations\n\nCertain diseases are too widespread or difficult to eradicate and require a routine vaccination program. In general, all breeder flocks should be vaccinated against Marek's disease, Newcastle disease (NDV), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD or Gumboro), chicken anemia virus (CAV), avian encephalomyelitis (AE), and fowl pox. Other vaccinations are added to the program as local disease challenges dictate. **A single program cannot be recommended for all regions.** **Follow label instructions provided by the vaccine manufacturer.** **Use only approved vaccines.** **Consult with local veterinarians to determine the best vaccination program for your area.**\n\n## BASIC BREEDER VACCINE APPLICATIONS\n\n| WEEKS OF AGE | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | |\n| ------------ | - | - | - | - | - | -- | -- | -- | -- | - |\n| IBD, Gumboro | | | | | | | | | | - Given between days 15–18, 21–25, 28–32, IBD live vaccinations based on maternal antibody decline and field challenge - Drinking water vaccination preferred - IBD immune vaccine complex |\n| Newcastle disease, moderate challenge areas, no velogenic Newcastle present | | | | | | | | | | - 2–3 live vaccinations, allow 4–6 weeks between last live vaccination and injected inactivated vaccine |\n| Newcastle disease, high challenge areas, velogenic Newcastle present | | AND | | | | | | | AND | - Simultaneous live (eye drop) and inactivated vaccine provides good protection in high challenge areas - Live boosting vaccinations every 30–60 days during production period may be needed to maintain high immunity |\n| Infectious bronchitis | | | | | | | | | | - Use Newcastle-bronchitis combination vaccines - 2–3 live vaccinations using multiple IB serotypes build cross- protective immunity (if serotypes have been identified in the area) - Last live vaccination should be administered as a spray - Live boosting vaccinations every 30–60 days during production period may be needed to maintain high immunity |\n| Avian encephalomyelitis | | | | | | OR | | | | - Given once between 6 and 15 weeks to prevent tremor in chicks as well as egg drops in breeder hens - Given via drinking water or often combined with fowl pox vaccine as a wing-web inoculation - Do not give live AE vaccines within 4 weeks of hatching egg collection - Flocks should be confirmed as AE-antibody positive before using hatching eggs; if negative, revaccinate and retest until positive |\n| Fowl pox | | | | | | | | | | - 1 or 2 vaccinations - Vaccination in birds less than 6 weeks should use highly attenuated fowl pox vaccine or pigeon pox - Use pigeon pox with fowl pox to provide better cross-protection - Most outbreaks due to poor vaccination technique - For more information, see Fowl Pox in Layers |\n| Chicken anemia virus | | | | | | OR | | | | - May be given in drinking water - May be combined with fowl pox and given as wing-web vaccination - Vaccinate at least 4 weeks before egg production - Breeder flocks should be confirmed as CAV-antibody positive before using the hatching eggs; if negative, revaccinate and retest until positive |\n\nLive hatchery vaccines, given subcutaneous Live vaccines, administered via wing-web inoculation Live vaccines, administered by drinking water, spray Inactivated vaccines, injected via intramuscular or or eyedrop subcutaneous route \\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n## Vaccination Recommendations *(continued)*\n\n## OPTIONAL BREEDER VACCINE APPLICATIONS\n\nUse if these diseases are prevalent in the area.

Chicks require immediate and easy access to water.\nIf using nipple drinkers, use only 360° activated nipples for IRBT chicks, as well as supplemental chick drinkers.\nNipple drinkers with splash cups provide additional support for IRBT chicks.\nKeep feed at the highest level in the feeder for several days after beak treatment.\nFeed on paper for 0-7 days.\nProvide extra light (30-50 lux) on nipple drinkers after beak treatment.\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a beak with a 5mm scale.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Seven days post-treatment)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a beak with a 5mm scale.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Four weeks post-treatment)\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a beak with a 5mm scale.)\n!\\[Image description\\](Properly trimmed beak)\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n# Precision Beak Trimming\n\nCauterize beak for 2 seconds at 650°C.\n\n> > When cauterizing blade is not hot enough or cauterization time is \\< 2 seconds, beak will continue to grow unevenly.\n> > If cauterizing blade is too hot or cauterization time is \\> 2 seconds, sensitive neuromas may form.\n> > Use a pyrometer to measure blade temperature, which should be approximately 650°C.\n> > Cauterizing blade color may be used as an approximate indicator of temperature (see below).

    "## Precautions when beak trimming birds:\n\nWater intake is the most important factor in the success of beak trimming. Chicks require immediate and easy access to water.\nDo not beak-trim sick or stressed birds.\nDo not hurry; handle chicks carefully to prevent errors and poor uniformity.\nProvide vitamins and electrolytes containing vitamin K in drinking water 2 days before and 2 days after beak trimming.\nWatch chicks after beak trimming to assess stress. Control the ambient temperature until birds appear comfortable and active.\nKeep feed at the highest level for several days after beak trimming.\nUse only well-trained crews.\nUse 360° activated nipples, supplemental chick drinkers and splash cups to encourage drinking. Lower the pressure to make it easy for the chicks to drink.\n\n# Floor Systems Management\n\n## REARING PERIOD\n\nIf rearing and laying are to be done in separate houses, use similiar feed and water systems.\nFrom an early age, accustom birds to humans by frequently walking through the house.\nRearing house should have elevated bird platforms with feed and water stations.\nRearing house should have perches.\nSolid perches above water and feed lines are preferred.\nFlocks housed in all-slat houses during lay should also be grown on slat or wire floors.\nSchedule feed lines to run as soon as birds are awake and again after most eggs have been laid.\n0-14 day mortality is typically \\< 2%.\nDuring rearing and laying, if mortality exceeds 0.1%/ week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.\nRemove mortality daily and dispose of properly.\n",
    "## TRANSFER\n\nThe flock can be moved into the laying facility at 15–17 weeks of age.\nComplete the vaccination program prior to transfer.\nLight hours and light intensity of rearing and laying houses should be matched at transfer.\nLight intensity should increase weekly for 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the layer house.\nPlace females on slats when placing birds in the laying house.\nReduce transfer stress by using water-soluble vitamins, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and probiotics in drinking water 3 days before and 3 days after transfer.\nHouse males in laying facilities before or at the same time as females. (Hy-Line Brown males may be moved a few days earlier to laying house to give them time to acclimate to new environment before arrival of females.)\nEstablish the correct male to female ratios.\nCheck every bird and verify correct identification. Check feather color and dubbing in male lines.\n",
    "## NEST TRAINING\n\nNest boxes can be placed in the house after brooding and can be parallel or perpendicular to the wall.\nFeed lines should not be directly in front of nests.\nStarting the day of transfer, open some nest box curtains to encourage nest exploration.\nTrain females to use nests by frequent morning walks (3–4 times/day) through the house for 8 weeks after birds are moved to the production house.\nWhile walking, move birds away from resting areas, out of corners, away from walls and toward nests.\nAutomatic nests should open two hours before lights- on and close two hours before lights start to dim.\nIf using string lights inside the nest, turn on 1 hour before house lights are turned on to attract females. Turn nest lights off 1 hour after house lights come on.\nDiscontinue nest light usage after 26 weeks of age.\nDuring the first week of laying, leave a few eggs in the nest to encourage females to use nests.\nEliminate dark areas in the laying house to discourage floor eggs.\nIf local regulations allow, electric deterrent wires can be used to keep birds away from the walls and corners to control floor eggs.\nQuickly remove floor eggs.\nBe sure all floor eggs are removed before lights go out at night.\nClose nests at night.\nKeep litter levels to a minimum during the nest training period. Litter deeper than 10 cm results in increased floor eggs and broodiness.\n\n## Nests\n\nNests should be dark, secluded, warm, and free of air drafts.\nNests should have a well-lit staging area at the entrance to allow for examination and easy access by females.\nAvoid barriers to nests, such as drinker lines positioned too low or swinging.\n\n## ASSESSING PULLET QUALITY\n\nCheck the physical condition of each bird. Birds with these abnormalities must be euthanized:\n\nCrooked neck\nCrow-headed males with little/no comb and wattle development\nHump back\nCurled toes\nCrossed beak\nCrooked keel\nBleeding feathers or feather follicles\nLameness\nFoot pad lesions\nLow social ranking - feathers pecked\nLeg abnormalities\nEye abnormalities (split pupil, tear-drop pupil, eye notch or gray iris)\nBody weight 225 g more or below average flock weight\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n",
    "## Perches\n\nPerches are essential for rearing birds that will go into an aviary system.\nPerches enrich the birds' environment and allow expression of normal behaviors.\nPerches encourage jumping habits, which develops leg and breast muscles, increases bone strength, and increases calcium content of bone. Birds able to jump will have better nesting behaviour and be more mobile in multi-tier aviary systems.\nPerches reduce social stress by providing safe resting sites.\nPerches increase living space in the facility.\nPerches allow birds to roost at night.\nUse of perches may reduce piling behavior in flocks.\n",
    "## Perch Design\n\nFloor-reared birds should have access to perches and slats no later than 10 days of age.\nPerch height should not exceed 1 m to avoid injuries.\nProvide 10–15 cm perch space per bird (check local regulations concerning perch space).\n!\\[Image description\\](A-frame perch design with measurements)\nWater line perch                             Perch over feeder\n\nSeparate perch rails by at least 30 cm to prevent cannibalistic pecking of birds on adjacent rails.\nPlace perches on slats to maintain good litter conditions and control floor eggs.\nAvoid slippery perches.\nPerches should support the bottom of the foot and be comfortable for the bird.\nIf possible, use the same perch style in rear and lay facilities.\nDo not use perches above water lines during rear if using an electric deterrent over the water line during production.\nPerches should be easy to clean and disinfect between flocks.\nSeal cracks, crevices, and open ends of pipes to reduce hiding areas for red mites (*Dermanyssus gallinae*).\nPerches are ideally placed over feed lines and on the top level in aviaries.\n!\\[Image description\\](Perch in aviary system)\n!\\[Image description\\](Elevated platform)\n!\\[Image description\\](Perch on slats)\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n# Hy-Line Brown Male Management\n\nThe Hy-Line Brown male's 18-week body weight is 2.14–2.31 kg.\nThe Hy-Line Brown male's adult body weight is 2.64–2.87 kg (40 weeks of age).\nThe Hy-Line Brown male should preferably not be beak trimmed. If treatment is required, beak treat in hatchery or tip at 7–10 days of age.\nAchieving male target body weights during rear is critical for optimum mating behavior and fertility.\nMales and females should receive the same feed and lighting schedule.\nFor breeder cages having a specific male feeder space, these spaces should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.\nMale and female breeders should reach sexual maturity at approximately the same time.\nFrom 0–4 weeks, rear males separately to improve male body weight gain.\n!\\[Image description\\](Red vent is indicative of a working Hy-Line Brown male.)\n",
    "At 5 weeks, mix males and females. In cages, mix 3–4 females into each male cage. If males appear weaker than females, mix males with females at a 1:1 ratio through the growing period.\nGrading males into pens based on body weight can improve male uniformity.\nMales and females must be co-mingled during the rearing period to become socialized and avoid mating problems as adults.\nKeep extra males in a separate pen; do not mix extra males with females.\nContinue culling males as needed during production.\nMaintain a mating ratio of 8 males for every 100 females throughout production in floor and cage systems.\nToo many males results in more fighting, less mating activity, disruption of social groups and lower fertility.\n\n## MALE EVALUATION – A BEAUTY CONTEST\n\n*Tall, masculine appearance with full red comb* Evaluate males at 10 weeks and at transfer.\n\nCull roosters with:\n\nLameness\nMore than 200 g below target body weight\nCurled toes\nFoot pad lesions\nPoor feathering\nPoor beaks\nLow social ranking\nHide in nests\nFeather pecked\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n# Artificial Insemination\n\nArtificial insemination can be used for PS in cage housing systems. Roosters and hens are typically housed separately in 1–2 bird cages. Use experienced personnel for semen collection and hen insemination to avoid injury and bird stress.\n\n## Semen Collection from Roosters\n\nOne rooster's semen is used for approximately 10 hens.\nDo not collect semen from the same rooster more than 2 times per week. Never collect from the same rooster on consecutive days.\nSemen without semen extender can be used up to 30 minutes from the first male collected; semen with extender can be refrigerated up to 4 hours.\nSemen collection is a two-person operation. To collect semen, hold both legs and position the male with the tail facing the person drawing the semen. Gently massage the male's back (lumbar area) in a downward motion starting at the ribcage and ending at the starting part of the tail.\n",
    "## Insemination of the Hen\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Semen collection)\nArtificial insemination should begin after a majority (70 to 80%) of the eggs are laid.\nAmount of semen to use is 5ml of semen per 125 females, regardless if extender is used. This equals 40 µL semen volume per female.\nThe insemination procedure is a two-person operation.\nUse good quality disposable plastic straws (70 mm) for insemination. Do not attempt to clean and reuse insemination straws.\nTrim the feathers around the vent area.\nThe bird handler should gently remove the hen from the cage and, using thumb and forefinger, spread apart the cloaca, resulting in the turning of the cloaca inside out (everting the oviduct).\nThe inseminator using an automatic pipette fills the straw with 40 µL of semen and inserts the insemination straw into the exposed (everted) opening to the oviduct to inseminate the hen.\n!\\[Image description\\](Insemination of hen)\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n# Good Lighting Practices\n\nIn cage housing, measure minimum light intensity at feeder on bottom tier cages, mid-way between lights.\nIn floor housing, measure minimum light intensity at level of bird's head.\nKeep light bulbs and bulb covers clean to prevent loss of light intensity.\nPrevent dark areas caused by too much distance between lights or burned out light bulbs.\nShiny or white surfaces reflect light and increase light intensity.\nTake local conditions into account which may require adaptations of lighting programs.\nLight hours of rearing and production houses should be matched at transfer.\nLight intensity should increase 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house (but not prior to 14 weeks of age). Final rearing house light intensity should match the laying house intensity.\nLight stimulation period should extend into peaking period (achieve 16 hours of light at about 25 weeks).\n\n## Light Program for Light-Controlled Housing\n\nHy-Line Brown breeders require a slower step-down of light hours from 0-9 weeks to prevent early sexual maturity and promote good body weight uniformity.\n",

    "## Feed Biosecurity\n\nNo animal sourced feed ingredients should be used in a PS flock due to the risk of pathogen contamination.\nUse only ingredients from an approved supplier list, ensuring that the suppliers have an adequate program to control contamination and potential risks.\nMaintain a strict policy for visitors to the feed mill following a downtime period matrix between the feed mill and other production facilities.\nIntroduce a personnel hygiene and clothing policy, with frequent evaluation of its efficacy.\nKeep a periodic cleaning (with documentation) of all areas and equipment in the feed mill.\nTake periodic environmental swabs of the feedmill and test finished feed for coliforms and *Salmonella*.\nMaintain records of the results to establish baselines to identify trends and critical periods.\nKeep a clean and a dirty route inside the feed mill grounds.\nFeed ingredients and internal feed delivery trucks should never cross routes inside the feed mill.\nHeat treatment of finished feed (86°C for 6 minutes) with consecutive chemical and or additive treatment (organic acids, formaldehyde, terpenes, essential oils) is the best way to clean and control subsequent pathogen growth on feed.\nImplement a pest control program and maintain with periodic internal and external audits, monitoring of rodenticide bait activity and an action plan in case of deviation.\nBulk feed should be delivered in a clean transport; avoid bagged feed and ingredients as an efficient way to reduce pest infestation.\nAudit the feed mill periodically for cleanliness and quality.\n",
    "## Feed Management\n\nIdeally, each variety should receive its recommended feed formulation.\nIf two PS varieties are in the same house and it is only possible to have one feed for both, formulate the feed for the variety having the lowest feed intake.\nKeep feed retention samples in case an investigation of feed quality is needed.\nIf a pre-lay diet cannot be used due to multiple flock ages, a developer diet with a higher calcium amount (1.4%) should be used.\nCheck the consistency of the feed (particle size, excessive powder or moisture, presence of foreign material, odd coloring or smell) between batches and report any changes in the normal appearance to the feed mill.\nEnsure that the feed formulas are constantly updated by the attending nutritionist after review of flock production data.\nDefine acceptable deviations of actual from theoretical ingredient usage and have an action plan in place in case of significant deviation.\nKeep production records for a minimum period of one year to allow traceability.\nKeep an open channel of communication and a complaint form between farms and feed mill.

    "¹ Minimum recommendations for rearing and laying periods.\n\nLocal regulations may limit dietary content of individual vitamins or minerals.\n\nLevels of 150-200mg/kg of Vitamin C can be beneficial during periods of stress.\n\n² Store premixes according to supplier's recommendations and observe 'use by' dates to ensure vitamin activity is maintained.\n\nInclusion of antioxidant may improve premix stability.\n\n³ Vitamin and mineral recommendations vary according to activity.\n\n⁴ Where heat treatment is applied to diet, higher levels of vitamins may be required.\n\nConsult with vitamin supplier regarding stability through individual production processes.\n\n⁵ A proportion of Vitamin D3 can be supplemented as 25-hydroxy D3 according to supplier's recommendations and applicable limits.\n\n⁶ Higher levels of Niacin are recommended in non-cage systems.\n\n⁷ Greater bioavailability and productivity may be possible with use of chelated mineral sources.\n\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n# Water Quality\n\nWater is the most important nutrient. Good quality water must be available to birds at all times.\nWater and feed consumption are directly related- when birds drink less, they consume less feed and production quickly declines.\nAs a general rule, healthy birds will consume 1.5– 2.0 times more water than feed. This ratio increases in high ambient temperatures.\nTest water quality at least 1 time per year. The water source will determine regularity of water testing.\nSurface water requires more frequent testing, as it is more affected by season and rainfall patterns.\nClosed wells taking water from aquifers or deep artesian basins will be more consistent in water quality, but are generally higher in dissolved mineral content.\nThe presence of coliform bacteria is an indicator that water source has been contaminated with animal or human waste.\nWhen collecting a well water sample, let water run for 2 minutes prior to collecting the sample. Water samples should be kept below 10°C and submitted to the lab in less than 24 hours.\nSome water sources contain high levels of dissolved minerals such as calcium, sodium and magnesium. When this occurs, amounts of these minerals in water have to be considered when formulating feed.\nIdeal water pH is 5–7 to promote good water sanitation, increase feed consumption and improve upper gastrointestinal health.\n",
    "Less than optimum water quality can have a significant impact on gut health which will lead to under utilization of nutrients in feed.\n",

    "¹ All nutrient requirements are based on the feed ingredient table at the back of this guide.\n\n² Do not feed Pre-Lay Diet earlier than 15 weeks of age. Do not feed Pre-Lay later than first egg as it contains insufficient calcium to support egg production. Implementing a pre-lay diet can be challenging in mixed-age flocks. If it's not possible to use the Pre-Lay diet, the calcium content of the last stage rearing diet (developer) must be increased to 1.4%.\n\n³ Recommended energy range is based on raw material energy values shown in feed ingredient table at back of this guide. It is important that target concentrations of dietary energy are adjusted according to energy system applied to raw material matrix.\n\n⁴ Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed.\n\n⁵ Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw materials used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only.\n\n⁶ Calcium should be supplied as fine calcium carbonate (mean particle size less than 2 mm). Coarse limestone (2–4 mm) can be introduced in Pre-Lay Diet at up to 50% of total limestone.\n\n⁷ Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.\n\n⁸ Oil levels can be increased to 2.0% in starter diets when given as a mash to control dust and increase feed palatability.\n\nAvoid excessive body weight gain after 12 weeks.\n\n\\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n# Production Period Nutritional Recommendations1,2\n\n| FEEDING PHASE PRODUCTION | PEAKING3 First egg until production drops 2% below peak | BREEDER 2 2% below peak to 92% | BREEDER 3 91-88% | BREEDER 4 87-83% | BREEDER 5 Less than 83% |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n",

    "1 All nutrient requirements are based on the feed ingredient table at the back of this guide.\n\n2 Crude protein, methionine+cystine, fat, linoleic acid, and/or energy may be changed to optimize egg size.\n\n3 Peaking nutrient levels are calculated for birds at peak egg production. Prior to achieving peak egg production, the nutrient requirements will be lower.\n\n4 A good approximation of the influence of temperature on energy needs is that for each 0.5°C change higher or lower than 22°C, subtract or add about 2 kcal /bird / day, respectively.\n\n5 Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed.\n\n* Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only.\n\n7 Calcium and available phosphorus requirements are determined by flock age. When production remains higher and diets are fed for longer than ages shown, it is recommended to increase to calcium and phosphorus concentrations of next feeding phase.\n\n• Calcium carbonate particle size recommendation varies throughout lay. Refer to Calcium Particle Size Table. Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility.\n\n9 Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.\n\n## \\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n# Feed Ingredient Tables\n",

Farm dedicated vehicles deliver feed to the PS house silos.\n\n## Dirty Road\n\nUse dirty road for manure, litter, dead birds, and moving out end-of-lay hens.\n\n## Feed\n\nUse good quality, tested feed ingredients.\nUse heat treatment (preferred) or chemical treatment of feed for control of *Salmonella* and coliform bacteria.\nDo not use animal source proteins.\nControl traffic and truck sanitation to mill.\n\n## Farm Construction\n\nUse smooth, impermeable materials whenever possible.\nBuild in drains for easy washing.\nUse gravel or concrete outside the buildings to help control rodents.\nHouses should be designed to prevent exposure to wild birds, insects and rodents.\n\n## Entry into Bird Area\n\nClean foot baths containing disinfectant should be placed outside entries to all poultry houses.\nA second change of footwear is required before entering the bird area.\nWorkers should be limited to a single house.\n\n## Farm Design\n\nA single-aged PS farm using an all-in, all-out principle is best to prevent transmission of disease.\nUse a perimeter fence around the farm to exclude livestock and traffic, and to mark the biosecure area of the farm.\nUse dedicated vehicles inside the clean area.\nUtilize deterrents to exclude wild birds.\nUse footbaths or shoe changes with Danish-style entry at each house.\n",
    "## Dead Bird Disposal\n\nQuickly and properly dispose of dead chickens daily.\nDispose of dead birds by rendering, incineration, or composting.\nFreeze dead birds if they will be disposed off-site.\n\n## Water\n\nEnsure good quality and sufficient quantity of water.\nTest twice annually.\nTreat water as necessary.\nSanitize water lines routinely.\nMaintain pH at appropriate levels.\n\n## Rodents\n\nRodents are known carriers of many poultry diseases and the most common reason for re- contamination of a cleaned and disinfected poultry facility. They are also responsible for house-to- house spread of disease on a farm.\nThe farm should be free of debris, tall grass and other places that could harbor rodents.\nThe perimeter of each house should have a 1 m wide area of crushed rock or concrete to prevent rodents from burrowing into the house.\nFeed and eggs should be stored in rodent-proof areas.\nBait stations should be placed around the perimeter of the house as well as throughout the house, and maintained with fresh rodenticide.\nFill all gaps in the entrances, walls and roof which could provide rodent access into the poultry house.\nFor more information, see \"Code of Practice for the Prevention of Rodent Infestation on Poultry Farms.\" \\<\\< Back to Table of Contents\n\n# Vaccination Recommendations\n\nCertain diseases are too widespread or difficult to eradicate and require a routine vaccination program. In general, all breeder flocks should be vaccinated against Marek's disease, Newcastle disease (NDV), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD or Gumboro), chicken anemia virus (CAV), avian encephalomyelitis (AE), and fowl pox. Other vaccinations are added to the program as local disease challenges dictate. **A single program cannot be recommended for all regions.** **Follow label instructions provided by the vaccine manufacturer.** **Use only approved vaccines.** **Consult with local veterinarians to determine the best vaccination program for your area.**\n\n## BASIC BREEDER VACCINE APPLICATIONS\n",
