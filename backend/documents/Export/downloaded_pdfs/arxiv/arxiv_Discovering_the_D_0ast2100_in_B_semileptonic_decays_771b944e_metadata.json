  "abstract": "The mass and width of the lightest scalar open-charm state listed in the\nReview of Particle Physics, the $D_0^\\ast(2300)$, are in puzzling tension with\npredictions from unitarized chiral perturbation theory (UChPT) and lattice QCD,\nwhich favor a lighter state at around $2100$ MeV. However, to date, no direct\nexperimental evidence for this lighter state exists. In an effort to facilitate\na direct observation, we introduce angular asymmetries of $B\\rightarrow D \\pi\n\\ell \\nu$ decays that allow for a direct extraction of the $D\\pi$ S-wave phase\nshift and discuss a novel measurement strategy for the Belle II experiment. We\nconduct a sensitivity study, finding that the Belle II experiment can determine\nthe pole location with sufficient precision to firmly establish the\n$D_0^\\ast(2100)$ using the currently available data set. We also investigate\nthe possibility and necessary statistics of measuring the $D\\pi$ isospin 1/2\nscattering length with an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the\npredictions from both UChPT and lattice QCD and the measurement by ALICE using\nfemtoscopy.",
