  "abstract": "As robots become increasingly prevalent in both homes and industrial\nsettings, the demand for intuitive and efficient human-machine interaction\ncontinues to rise. Gesture recognition offers an intuitive control method that\ndoes not require physical contact with devices and can be implemented using\nvarious sensing technologies. Wireless solutions are particularly flexible and\nminimally invasive. While camera-based vision systems are commonly used, they\noften raise privacy concerns and can struggle in complex or poorly lit\nenvironments. In contrast, radar sensing preserves privacy, is robust to\nocclusions and lighting, and provides rich spatial data such as distance,\nrelative velocity, and angle. We present a gesture-controlled robotic arm using\nmm-wave radar for reliable, contactless motion recognition. Nine gestures are\nrecognized and mapped to real-time commands with precision. Case studies are\nconducted to demonstrate the system practicality, performance and reliability\nfor gesture-based robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work that treats gesture\nrecognition and robotic control separately, our system unifies both into a\nreal-time pipeline for seamless, contactless human-robot interaction.",
