  "abstract": "Existing similarity-based weakly supervised learning approaches often rely on\nprecise similarity annotations between data pairs, which may inadvertently\nexpose sensitive label information and raise privacy risks. To mitigate this\nissue, we propose Uncertain Similarity and Unlabeled Learning (USimUL), a novel\nframework where each similarity pair is embedded with an uncertainty component\nto reduce label leakage. In this paper, we propose an unbiased risk estimator\nthat learns from uncertain similarity and unlabeled data. Additionally, we\ntheoretically prove that the estimator achieves statistically optimal\nparametric convergence rates. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and\nreal-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification\nperformance compared to conventional similarity-based approaches.",
