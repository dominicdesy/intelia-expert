  "abstract": "Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of\ndimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion,\nor in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can\nbe approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\\braket{\\psi|A|\\psi}|$\nover a small collection $\\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\\ket{\\psi}\\in\n(\\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is\n$d$-local, \\textit{i.e.,} $\\deg(A)\\le d$, we have the following\ndiscretization-type inequality:\n  \\[ \\|A\\|\\le C(d)\\max_{\\psi\\in \\mathbf{X}_n}|\\braket{\\psi|A|\\psi}|.\n  \\] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\\mathbf{X}_n$ of\n$\\psi$'s, termed a \\emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and\nconsists of product states, and can have\n  cardinality as small as $(1+\\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously,\nnorm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$\n\\cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$\n\\cite{BGKT}.\n  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all\nlevels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.",
