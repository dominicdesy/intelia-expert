  "abstract": "Correlators of affine Kac-Moody currents evaluate to a sum over\nmulti-color-trace contributions. We present a `single-trace current system'\ndefined on a genus 0 Riemann surface, whose correlators evaluate to precisely\nthe single-trace term in the evaluation of a standard affine Kac-Moody at level\n1. We demonstrate that using the single-trace current system in genus 0\nBerkovits-Witten twistor string correlators gives pure $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ super\nYang-Mills tree amplitudes, and explain how this works both at the level of the\nstring theory correlator and from the perspective of the effective field\ntheory. We explain how using the single-trace current system in genus 0\ncorrelators of the ambitwistor string gives pure Yang-Mills tree amplitudes,\nand briefly discuss a proposal to go to higher loops.",
