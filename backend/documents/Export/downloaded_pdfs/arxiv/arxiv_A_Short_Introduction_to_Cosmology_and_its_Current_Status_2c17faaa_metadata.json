  "abstract": "The current cosmological model, known as the $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model\n(or $\\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of\ncontemporary theoretical physics. It is a well-defined mathematical model which\ndepends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of\npredictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of\nwell-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics,\nstatistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new,\nunseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with\nremarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the\nunseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for\ninconsistencies in the model. In these lectures, we lay the foundations of\nmodern cosmology.",
