  "abstract": "Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal\nwelfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However,\ntraditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and\nlimited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages\nopen-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal\nbehavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines\nstate-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking\nand segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for\nrobust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal\nocclusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig\nmonitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset\nfor multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall\naccuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing\nmethods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3%\nidentity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular\ndesign suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further\nvalidation across species would be required. The open-source implementation\nprovides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision\npig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous\nanalysis.",
