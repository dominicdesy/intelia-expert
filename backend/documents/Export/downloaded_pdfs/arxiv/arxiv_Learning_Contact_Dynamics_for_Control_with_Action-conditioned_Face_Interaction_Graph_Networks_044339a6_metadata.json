  "abstract": "We present a learnable physics simulator that provides accurate motion and\nforce-torque prediction of robot end effectors in contact-rich manipulation.\nThe proposed model extends the state-of-the-art GNN-based simulator (FIGNet)\nwith novel node and edge types, enabling action-conditional predictions for\ncontrol and state estimation tasks. In simulation, the MPC agent using our\nmodel matches the performance of the same controller with the ground truth\ndynamics model in a challenging peg-in-hole task, while in the real-world\nexperiment, our model achieves a 50% improvement in motion prediction accuracy\nand 3$\\times$ increase in force-torque prediction precision over the baseline\nphysics simulator. Source code and data are publicly available.",
