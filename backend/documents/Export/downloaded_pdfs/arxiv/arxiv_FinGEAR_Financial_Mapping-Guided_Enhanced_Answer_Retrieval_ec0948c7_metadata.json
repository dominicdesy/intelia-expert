  "abstract": "Financial disclosures such as 10-K filings present challenging retrieval\nproblems due to their length, regulatory section hierarchy, and domain-specific\nlanguage, which standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models underuse.\nWe introduce FinGEAR (Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval), a\nretrieval framework tailored to financial documents. FinGEAR combines a finance\nlexicon for Item-level guidance (FLAM), dual hierarchical indices for\nwithin-Item search (Summary Tree and Question Tree), and a two-stage\ncross-encoder reranker. This design aligns retrieval with disclosure structure\nand terminology, enabling fine-grained, query-aware context selection.\nEvaluated on full 10-Ks with queries aligned to the FinQA dataset, FinGEAR\ndelivers consistent gains in precision, recall, F1, and relevancy, improving F1\nby up to 56.7% over flat RAG, 12.5% over graph-based RAGs, and 217.6% over\nprior tree-based systems, while also increasing downstream answer accuracy with\na fixed reader. By jointly modeling section hierarchy and domain lexicon\nsignals, FinGEAR improves retrieval fidelity and provides a practical\nfoundation for high-stakes financial analysis.",
