  "abstract": "It is often of interest to test a global null hypothesis using multiple,\npossibly dependent, $p$-values by combining their strengths while controlling\nthe Type I error. Recently, several heavy-tailed combinations tests, such as\nthe harmonic mean test and the Cauchy combination test, have been proposed:\nthey map $p$-values into heavy-tailed random variables before combining them in\nsome fashion into a single test statistic. The resulting tests, which are\ncalibrated under the assumption of independence of the $p$-values, have shown\nto be rather robust to dependence. The complete understanding of the\ncalibration properties of the resulting combination tests of dependent and\npossibly tail-dependent $p$-values has remained an important open problem in\nthe area. In this work, we show that the powerful framework of multivariate\nregular variation (MRV) offers a nearly complete solution to this problem.\n  We first show that the precise asymptotic calibration properties of a large\nclass of homogeneous combination tests can be expressed in terms of the angular\nmeasure -- a characteristic of the asymptotic tail-dependence under MRV.\nConsequently, we show that under MRV, the Pareto-type linear combination tests,\nwhich are equivalent to the harmonic mean test, are universally calibrated\nregardless of the tail-dependence structure of the underlying $p$-values. In\ncontrast, the popular Cauchy combination test is shown to be universally honest\nbut often conservative; the Tippet combination test, while being honest, is\ncalibrated if and only if the underlying $p$-values are tail-independent.\n  One of our major findings is that the Pareto-type linear combination tests\nare the only universally calibrated ones among the large family of possibly\nnon-linear homogeneous heavy-tailed combination tests.",
