## Drinking Water Management

Drinking Water Management is essential to ensure optimum health and the best performance of a poultry flock. Successful water sanitation begins with a thorough water line cleaning program. Water system and water source variability can create cleaning challenges; the following information is a guideline to ensure optimal drinking water supply.

The elements of Drinking Water Management Practices as they apply to a poultry house include:

Annual water analysis.
Water line sanitation, biofilm purge prior to bird placement. Consult equipment suppliers before using products to prevent damage.

## Water Line Sanitation – Biofilm Purge Prior to Placement

| Product or Method | Instructions or Directions for Use |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| High Pressure Flush | 1 Minute per 60 feet of line. Do not offer cold water to brood chicks. |
| Chlorine 5% | 350 ml/gallon stock solution. |
| Citric Acid | 800-1000 grams/gallon stock solution. |
| Vinegar | No dilution. Add at 1 gallon/1 gallon stock solution. |
| Ammonia | 350-500 ml/gallon stock solution. |

| PWT Jones Hamilton | 1 pack (16 oz.) / 2.5 gallons stock solution. Allow 8 hours for cleansing. Flush |
| Sterilex | 12 oz per gallon of water. Allow the system to stand for 12-24 hours. |

## Drinking Water Sanitation (Birds in Barn)

| Product or Method | Instructions or Directions for Use |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Ammonia (clear household) | 100-150 ml/gallon stock solution. |
| Chlorine 5% (Closed System) | 60 ml/gallon stock solution |
| Chlorine 5% (Open System) | 150 ml/gallon stock solution |
| Citric Acid | 200 grams/gallon stock solution. |
| High Pressure Flush | 1 Minute per 60 feet of line. Do not offer cold water to brood chicks. |
| Hydrogen Peroxide 35% | 15-30 ml/gallon stock solution |
| Premise Aqua | 1 part Premise Aqua/40 parts water |
| Proxy-Clean ™ | 8 oz. / 5 gallons stock solution. Treat for 24 hours. |
| Ultraviolet Technology | Follow manufacturers guidelines. |
| Vinegar (white household) | 4L Vinegar = 1 US gallon stock solution. |

## Water Acidification

| Product | Directions for Use |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Acidomix | 0.25 – 3 grams/ liter drinking water. Dose will vary according to water hardness. |
| Acid-Pak 4-Way 2X | Add to drinking water at 0.5g/liter. |
| Acidistat | 100 – 400 ml's per 19L stock solution. Dispense through a proportioner at 1% (1:100) |
| Agri-Acid | 300 – 1000 ml's per 20L stock solution. Dose will vary according to water hardness. |
| Citric Acid | 200 grams/gallon stock solution. |
| Combiacid | |
| Jefacid™™ | Create stock solution so ph is \<5, leave in water line for at least 24 hours. Flush |

Note—A calibrated pH meter must be used to accurately measure the final pH of the drinking water. The use of antibiotics may lower the pH of drinking water.

## Water Quality - Equipment Management

| Product or Method | Instructions or Directions for Use |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Control Method | Action to be Taken |
| All Drinker Types | Use a water meter and record water consumption daily. Refer to Table 6 for daily water consumption guide. Flush lines weekly at high pressure. Check water filters weekly, replace regularly. |
| Nipple Drinkers | Recommended 8-12 birds/nipple. It is recommended that nipple flow be set at 25 ml/minute. Maintain water pressure per manufacturers recommendations. Lines must be level with no air blocks. Monitor and adjust height daily - at chicks' eye level for the first two days; at a 45 degree angle starting at day 3; then, gradually raise lines so that the birds drink straight up by day 10. |
| Bell Drinkers | Recommended 10-12 bell drinkers/1000 birds with a water depth of 1.9 cm (0.75 inches). Monitor and adjust drinker height daily - up to seven days of age, the top lid of the automatic drinker should be set at the height of the average birds back; then, the drinkers should be raised to a level where the bottom of the drinker is even with the average birds back. |

## Disinfection of Wells

It is important that all wells are periodically disinfected with chlorine to ensure they are free from bacterial contamination. Test for bacteria frequently (at least twice per year), and treat again as necessary.

The method outlined below describes a general procedure to disinfect a well. If you have any questions about this procedure, contact your local environmental health officer for advice.

## Procedure

Pour unscented household bleach (5-6% chlorine) directly into the well. The chart below outlines the amount of chlorine to add based on the diameter fo the well of pipe and the depth of the water in the well or pipe.
Help the chlorine mix by running a hose back into the well for 30 minutes. Run each tap (including outside house bibs) until you can smell chlorine.
Open the valve or plug at the top of the pressure tank to allow the solution to contact the entire inside sur- face of the tank, then close the valve or plug.
Leave the chlorinated water in the system for 24 hours. This is a very strong chlorine solution (50

Generally, hardness levels between 80 and 100 mg/L (as CaCO3) are considered acceptable; levels greater than 200 mg/L are considered poor but can be tolerated; those in excess of 500 mg/L are normally considered unacceptable.
