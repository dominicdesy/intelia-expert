## GUT HEALTH ON THE FARM

## ESOPHAGUS

## GIZZARD

Grinds large particles in feed to ensure optimal digestion.

During the grinding action, protein starts to be digested, which is essential for optimal nutrient absorption.

## CECA

Major site of bacterial fermentation where microbes produce vitamins, organic acids, and short-chain fatty acids from the non-digestible components of the feed.

## CROP

Storage of food and some early fermentation by the bacteria that line the crop.

Ensuring optimal crop fill during the first 48 hours on the farm is important for chick development.

## PROVENTRICULUS

Responsible for initiating protein digestion through secretion of hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin.

LIVER ILEUM JEJUNUM DUODENUM RECTUM \& CLOACA VENT

## COLON

Predominately involved with water absorption and final formation of fecal droppings.

## SMALL INTESTINE

Complete chemical breakdown and absorption of nutrients occurs.

This relies on optimal villi development and correct gizzard function.

## GUT HEALTH ON THE FARM

## The requirements of the gut depend on bird age and management factors on the farm

## DEVELOPMENT

Gut tissues Gut immunity Gut microbiota This phase is the early part of life where the gut is set up for the lifespan of the bird.

## TRANSITION

Feed changes Vaccinations Environmental Handling This phase occurs during periods when there is a change in the bird's life that could disrupt the gut.

The goal during this phase is to prevent a reduction in nutrient absorption and overgrowth of less favorable bacteria.

## MAINTENANCE

Gut has developed Stable microbiota Promote integrity During this phase, the gut is fully developed, and the aim is to ensure the gut is supported to conserve homeostasis.

## Top Tip

Understanding what the gut needs at any time in the bird's life ensures we provide the bird with the support it needs, when it needs it.

## Water sanitation protocol

1

## Ensure adequate cleaning between flocks

Remove biofilm e.g., 50 ppm hydrogen peroxide in lines for 24 hours, then flush Remove scale Target a 5 pH by using a weak acid (e.g., citric acid) for 24 hours, then flush 2

## Prior to bird arrival

Use sanitizer in standing water after cleaning Flush with fresh, sanitized water just before birds arrive 3

## Throughout the life of the flock

Sanitize e.g., chlorine, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide Acidify the water i.e., 5.5-6.5 pH Biofilms can form in 6 weeks, so flushing lines with hydrogen peroxide during the life of a breeder flock can be beneficial Scan this QR code for the Aviagen Brief: Water Line Sanitation Aviagen

## Gut surface development during brooding

Colonization of the gut with bacteria to establish the gut microbiota Rapid growth of the villi to increase the gut surface area for maximum absorption of nutrients Maturation and education of the chicks' immune system Bacteria cells Gut cells Immune cells Digestive enzymes Stimulation of digestive enzyme production

## DID YOU KNOW?

The intestinal tract of a chick develops **four times faster** than any other part of the bird's body during brooding. This means that **brooding is the optimal time to promote gut development** for gut health throughout the bird's life.

Gut barrier strengthens to increase gut integrity Tight junctions hold the gut cells together

## Gut surface development during brooding

## Villi Development

Rapidly dividing cells elongate the villi due to multiple points of villi growth.

After the brooding period, villi only grow at the base, so the rate of villi growth slows down.

At hatch First 4-10 days Mature cell turnover DID YOU KNOW?

Part of the reason for improved biological efficiency is that the modern broiler has longer villi than heritage breeds. **Longer villi mean more surface area for optimal nutrient absorption.** If villi growth is not optimal during brooding, the surface area of the gut will be reduced throughout the life of the bird, which will impact efficiency.

## Top Tip

Application of probiotics or organic acids during brooding can stimulate villi development.

## Common gut issues seen during brooding

Retained yolk sac

The yolk sac is absorbed after hatch, providing chicks with **nutrients and essential maternal antibodies**.
Yolk Stalk

It is usually absorbed in **2-3 days**.
If brooding conditions are not optimal, the contents are not absorbed, **leading to a retained yolk sac**.
Jejunum Yolk Sac Ileum

## Top Tip

Yolk sac absorption relies on a comfortable chick.

Do the chicks have good access to feed and water?
Is the temperature and ventilation correct?

## GUT HEALTH ON THE FARM

## Common gut issues seen during brooding

Black gizzard surface

This is usually a sign of **dehydration after hatch**.
It is caused by **rupture of the small blood vessels** on the gizzard surface.
When the blood comes into contact with the acidic gizzard contents, **it turns black due to the stomach acid**.

## Top Tip

As long as the chicks get good access to feed and water, the gizzard will rapidly repair itself.

## Common gut issues seen during brooding

Pasty vents

**Dehydration** Heat stress can impact gut function and increase the risk of dehydration.
**Cold stress** This can reduce chick activity and impact intestinal function.
**Incorrect feed formulation** Diets that increase intestinal viscosity increase the risk of pasty vents.
**Poor water quality** This can introduce pathogens to the chicks, impacting gut health.

## Checking gut health

## throughout the life of the flock

!\[Image description\](Examples of normal cecal (left) and fecal (right) droppings.)
The droppings give a **quick and easy** indicator of gut health.
If the gut is working correctly **the droppings will be normal**.
Check the droppings daily.
!\[Image description\](Aviagen logo)

## GUT HEALTH ON THE FARM

Assess the droppings on a daily **basis**, as this gives an indication of the status of the gut.
If the droppings **start to become abnormal**, it is important to act quickly to solve the issue.
The next page shows **factors that can impact gut health**.

## Top Tip

Administer probiotics, organic acids, or phytogenic products for 3-4 days as soon as you recognize a gut health issue. This helps to support the gut while the cause is identified.

Poor pigmentation can indicate poor gut health.

In corn-fed birds (or those given pigments in the diet) the pigmentation of the legs is a good indicator of nutrient absorption, as the pigments are absorbed with fat.

DID YOU KNOW?

Water acidification can help **increase fat absorption** and thus increase pigmentation in corn-fed birds.

## Key features of a healthy intestinal tract

The gut surface is pink and free of inflammation.

Mucus is essential for gut function; however, in a normal healthy gut, the mucus should not be obvious.

Gut contents should get darker and firmer as it passes through the small intestine.

DUODENUM JEJUNUM ILEUM

## DID YOU KNOW?

Assessing gut health should be done on fresh tissues. After about **20 minutes post-mortem**, the gut tissues undergo rapid autolysis, which results in the loss of key gut structures.

The gut wall should fold back rapidly when cut.
