## Management Supplement

## Use this Cobb Breeder Management Supplement along with the Cobb Breeder Management Guide as aids to build your management program.

Management must meet the basic needs of the stock but also be optimized to attain the full potential of the breed. Our recommendations in this supplement are based on current scientific knowledge and practical experience and reflect the genetic potential of the Cobb hens based on Total Eggs and Hatch Percent records taken from the top 25% of Cobb flocks worldwide.

This supplement should be used as a guide only and adapted locally according to your own experience when projecting performance from all flocks in a particular operation. You should be aware of any local legislation which may influence the management practices that you choose to adopt.

## Management Highlights

✓ Ideal brooding conditions (feed, light, ventilation, bedding and water management) must always be implemented and closely monitored to ensure physiological requirements are met for optimum bird comfort.
✔ Research and field results have shown that Cobb's current feed specifications have a positive impact on flock uniformity, fleshing, feathering, and breeder performance.
✔ Adequate feeder space and flock uniformity are essential to achieve optimum performance.
✔ Observe the flock during feeding as often as possible – weekly at a minimum. This will help ensure feed distribution of \<3 minutes with chain and pan feeders in the dark and proper feed space requirements.
✔ Monitor daily water intake and provide adequate drinkers (maximum 10 birds / nipple or 75 birds / bell drinker).
✔ Biosecurity should always be top priority. Flock health is essential to achieve breed potential.
Today's modern breeder chickens are more efficient, more productive, and more robust than prior generations. This progress is due to improved genetics and advances in husbandry methods that enhance the longevity, welfare outcomes and performance of breeder chickens at rearing and laying farms.

Cobb continues to expand the variety of breed crosses to meet global customer needs and expectations. Cobb technical representatives are always available for any questions and assistance.

* Light stimulation should be at 150 to 154 days (or 21 weeks and 3 days to 22 weeks) of age. If fleshing is ahead at 16 and 20 weeks, the target mixing (and lighting) could start earlier at 147 days. Bodyweight (BW) should increase 36% between 16 to 20 weeks to facilitate fleshing and pelvic fat deposition. Feed increases between 14 to 20 weeks should be accelerated to achieve the target weight, fleshing and fat deposition at lighting.

* The fleshing and fat scores at 19 and 20 weeks of age determine the correct age for lighting. All rearing data including the BW curve, feeding curve, feed formulation, fleshing and pelvic fat scoring should be used to make this decision.

* It is essential for males and females to have sexual synchronization at mixing. If male maturity is ahead of the female, males can be moved or mixed 1 week later. Temporarily mixing less males (5 to 7%) is another option. Please refer to the Cobb male supplement for more information.

## The Essentials

Uniformity - Starts at placement. Achieve early BW and uniformity target at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age.
Feed guide - Establish a feeding curve to achieve +/-2% of the BW standard during rearing. The feeding curve should be supported by the feed specifications and local conditions.
Female condition - To accomplish proper flock condition, it is important to achieve BW and fleshing targets at 12, 16, and 20 weeks of age.
BW (1 to 16 weeks) - Prevent over weight issues in the first 16 weeks of the rearing period. Achieve +/- 2% of the standard BW.
BW increase (16 to 20 weeks) - A BW increase of 36% should occur and this is normally obtained by increasing the feed by 40 to 42% in this same period.
Light Stimulation - Flock performance is directly correlated to flock condition at light stimulation. The goal is for 100% of the females to have a fleshing score between #3 to #4 and \>85% of the females with pelvic fat.

## Formulas Applied in Breeder Performance, Hatchability and Fertility Calculation

Total Eggs (%HW) = Total Eggs Produced / Average Number of Hens for the week
HH (Hen Housed) = Number of Hens at Capitalization (normally 25 weeks)
Hatching Eggs (%HW) = Total Eggs (%HW) \* % HE Weekly
Weekly Total Eggs/HH = (1 - Cum. Mortality%) \* Total Eggs (HW%) \*7
Weekly Hatching Eggs/HH = (1 - Cum. Mortality%) \* Hatching Eggs (HW%) \*7
Cum. Total Eggs/HH = Cum. Total Eggs Produced / Hen Housed
Cum. Hatching Eggs/HH = Cum. Hatching Eggs Produced / Hen Housed
Weekly Chicks/HH = Weekly Hatching Eggs/HH \* Weekly Hatchability (%)
Cum. Chicks/HH = Cum. Chicks produced / Hen Housed
Cum. Hatchability = (Cum. Chicks/HH) / (Cum. Hatching Eggs/HH)
Weekly Fertile Eggs/HH = Weekly Hatching Eggs/HH \* Weekly Fertility (%)
Cum. Fertility = (Cum. Fertile Eggs/HH)/(Cum. Hatching Eggs/HH)

* Weights correspond to the weekly age based on the placement or hatch date. Between 2 to 22 weeks, weights should be taken when the crop is empty (dry BW) or at least 6 to 7 hours after the last feeding. Another option is to weigh the birds after the lights come on and before feeding takes place. Please consult with your Cobb technical representative for feed and light programs.

\*\* Nutrient requirements are determined by growth models combined with field data from the best performing Cobb flocks worldwide.

\*\*\* Feed intake is developed based on Cobb feed specifications (see page 15-16) recommended for Cobb 500 females in their comfort zone (18-28°C, or 64-82°F).

Feed Intake, Nutrient Intake, and BW Guide for Cobb 500 Slow Feather Female (Dark Out)

## FEED INCREASE PLAN FOR PULLETS

Feed intake is for guide purposes only and needs to be adjusted based on actual nutritional specifications to achieve the target BW and optimum conditions for the birds. Feed type: ST = starter, GR = grower, DL = developer, B1 = breeder 1 When daily feeding is done in rearing, the weekly feed amount can be increased by 2 to 3g from 5 to 14 weeks by using a lower density grower diet while maintaining the same nutrient intake/bird/day. This will help reduce stress and achieve more feed availability for proper feed distribution.

Please refer to Cobb Breeder Management Guide for general flock recommendations and uniformity management. \>75% flock uniformity (\<9% CV) is preferred consistently during the rearing period to achieve proper condition prior to light stimulation.

✓ This feed amount is based on crumble feed. Mash feed may require higher calorie intake and adjustments have to be made accordingly.

✓ The feed amount is based on thermoneutral conditions (21°C, or 70°F, from 3 weeks of age). Consult with your local technical service representative when feeding in extreme climate conditions.

✓ When production reaches more than 86%, the peak feed plan can be increased or extended 1 to 2 weeks.

✓ Please refer to the Cobb Breeder Management Guide or contact your Cobb technical representative concerning post peak feeding.

* Change to male feed is suggested at 28 weeks of age. The higher nutrient level in breeder feed may assist with testicular development in the final phase of male sexual maturity at 24 to 30 weeks. However, it can be earlier at 21 to 22 weeks if males are consuming feed from female feeders.

\*\* If the energy level needs to be adjusted for local conditions, then all other nutrients (protein/amino acids) need to be adjusted at the same ratio.

The energy values are based on AMEn apparent metabolizable energy corrected by nitrogen, WPSA.

The amino acids values are based on Standardized Ileal Digestibility (SID) assays.

✓ Add at least 0.75 to 1% added ingredient fat or oil (to developer, breeder 1 and 2) throughout the year in tropical and subtropical regions or during the hot summer months.

✔ The Cobb nutrient recommendations are based on crumble feed. If mash feed is provided, increase 50 to 100 kcal/kg to the energy recommendations.
