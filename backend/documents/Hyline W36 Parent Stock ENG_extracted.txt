## Transportation to Breeder Farm

## Transportation

Use a truck designed for transportation of chicks from hatchery to breeder farm.
Truck should be environmentally controlled, maintaining 26-28°C at 70% relative humidity (measured inside chick box); minimum air flow of 0.7 m³ per minute.
Provide space between stacks of chick boxes for air flow.
Due to transportation stress, it is important that receiving truck at the airport, as well as the brooder house, have optimum environmental conditions.
Temperature recorders are placed in chick boxes during transport. It is important to return these recorders quickly to Hy-Line International for evaluation.

## Chick Placement

Unload boxes quickly and gently place chicks in brooding area.
Brood chicks in groups from similar aged breeder flocks.
Chick box temperature recorders monitor temperature during transportation from hatchery to breeder farm.

## House Preparation before Arrival of Chicks

Brooding area should be environmentally controlled and properly sealed to eliminate all outside light.
All-in, all-out (single age) management provides the best control for sanitation programs and disease prevention.
Brooder house should be completely cleaned and disinfected. Confirm effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection with environmental swabs.
Allow 4 weeks downtime between flocks.

## Brooding Recommendations

Brood chicks in groups from similar aged breeder flocks.
Brood male and female chicks separately from 0-4 weeks.
Modify temperature as needed to meet chicks' comfort needs.
Adjust brooding temperature according to relative humidity. Lower temperature should be used with higher relative humidity.
Find optimum balance of temperature, humidity and ventilation rate for chick comfort.
For every 5 percentage point increase above 60% relative humidity, reduce brooding temperatures by 1°C.
HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK

Pre-heat brooding houses prior to chick placement: 24 hours in normal climates, 48 hours in cool climates and 72 hours in cold climates.
Establish proper house temperature of 32-35°C (air temperature measured at chick level) and 60% humidity 24 hours before chick placement; floor temperature should be 32°C.
Bright light (30-50 lux) during 0-7 days helps chicks quickly find feed and water and adapt to new environment.
After first week, reduce temperature weekly 2-3°C until reaching 21°C.
Chicks' body weight should double between arrival on farm and 7 days of age.

## Floor Brooding in Rings

## BROODING TEMPERATURE

!\[Image description\](Diagram of brooding temperature showing chick comfort zones and temperature measurements.)
• Provide temperature zones within the brooding ring accessible to the chicks. This allows them to seek their comfort zone.

• Cloacal temperature of the chicks should be 40°C.

!\[Image description\](Diagrams showing correct and incorrect chick distribution patterns in a brooding area.)

## BROODER RING DESIGN

## Supplemental chick drinkers

Drinking water should be tested for quality and cleanliness from source and end of the water line.
Flush water lines prior to chick arrival.
Flush water lines weekly during rearing and production periods.
Clean supplemental chick drinkers frequently to avoid build-up of organic matter that could promote bacterial growth.
Use a ratio of 80 chicks / drinker (25 cm drinker diameter).
Chicks should not have to move more than 1 meter to find water.
Use vitamins and electrolytes in chicks' water (avoid sugar-based products to prevent growth of microorganisms).

## Paper/Litter

Cover entire floor of brooder ring with paper.
Put starter feed on paper for 0–3 days. For beak-treated chicks, feed on paper for 0–7 days.
Remove paper at 7–14 days to avoid the buildup of manure.
Litter should not be more than 5 cm deep.
Spread litter after concrete floors have warmed.

## Tray feeders

Use a ratio of 80 chicks / feeder.
Use good quality crumble starter feed consisting of uniform 1–2 mm particles.
!\[Image description\](Diagram of an automatic feeding and watering system in a brooder ring.)

## Management

Enlarge brooder rings at 3 days to increase group size.
Continue enlarging brooder rings until rings are removed by 14 days.
Gradually remove supplemental drinkers and tray feeders beginning at 3 days.

## Partial House Brooding

(A section of rearing house is partitioned and used for brooding) Automatic drinkers Automatic feeders 60 cm high barrier Tray feeders 80 chicks / feeder Paper over slat or litter floor Supplemental chick drinkers 80 chicks / 25 cm diameter drinker Curtain Partial house brooding provides uniform temperature to chicks **CORRECT** Chicks evenly distributed in brooding area, active and sounding content **HOT** Chicks spread out, lethargic; appear sleeping **COLD** Chicks gathered into groups sounding distressed **UNEVEN VENTILATION** Chicks congregated in one part of brooding area, avoiding drafts, noise or uneven light distribution

## Cage Brooding

Place feed on cage paper 0–3 days to encourage consumption. For beak-treated chicks, feed on paper for 0–7 days.
Paper should cover entire floor.
Place feed in front of permanent feeder to train chicks to move toward feeders.
Fill automatic feed line to its highest level and adjust chick guards; allow access to automatic feed line from first day.
Remove paper by 7–14 days of age to avoid build-up of feces.
Rearing cage should be constructed of 2 mm diameter wire with spacing between wires to provide maximum cell size
of 18 mm x 18 mm.
Cage floors should not be slippery or sloped.
Rearing cage height should be minimum of 48 cm. If too low, males may experience leg problems and keel bone
pressure sores.
Start chicks in upper tiered cages which are usually warmer and brighter. Ensure there are no shadows on drinkers.
Chicks from young breeder flocks should be placed in warmer and brighter areas of the house.
Chicks' body weight should double between arrival on farm and 7 days of age.
Use vitamins and electrolytes in chicks' water (avoid sugar-based products to prevent growth of microorganisms).
Pullets reared in cages should be transferred to breeder cages with similiar feeder and drinker types.

An intermittent lighting program is preferred. If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0–7 days, then use 22 hours of light from 0–3 days and 21 hours of light from 4–7 days.
Do not use 24 hours of light.
Bright light (30–50 lux) during 0–7 days helps chicks quickly find feed and water and adapt to the new environment.
After the first week, begin slow step-down lighting program (see Light Program for Light-Controlled Housing).

## INTERMITTENT LIGHTING PROGRAM FOR CHICKS

|
|
| 2 hours | • Preferred lighting technique |
| 4 hours | • Use from 0–7 days (can be used up to 14 days of age) |
| 2 hours | • Intermittent dark periods provide rest periods for chicks |
| 4 hours | • Synchronizes chicks' activities and feedings |
| 2 hours | • Establishes more natural behavior of rest and activity |
| 4 hours | • May improve 7 day livability and pullet body weight |
| • May improve antibody response from vaccinations |
| • Some dark periods may be shortened or removed to accommodate work schedules |

## Drinking Systems

Drinking water should be tested for quality and cleanliness from source and end of the water line.
Flush water lines weekly during the brooding period, starting the day prior to chick arrival. Flush water lines weekly during rearing and production periods.
Do not give cold water to chicks. Be careful when flushing water lines for chicks. Allow water time to warm up in the house so chicks are comfortable drinking.
Flush chick water lines at night to allow water to warm in water lines.
Maintain water temperature of 20–25°C during brooding period.
Nipple drinkers should deliver minimum 60 ml per minute/nipple, with easy activation of the drinkers by chicks.
Use the same drinker type in rearing and laying houses.
!\[Image description\](Diagram of cup and nipple drinkers for chicks, illustrating their use and level relative to the chick.)
Cup drinkers should be manually filled during 0–3 days to train chicks to drink.
Open drinkers (bell, plasson, supplemental chick drinkers, trough) are easily contaminated and should be cleaned daily.
Adjust nipple water system pressure to create hanging drop to help chicks find water for up to 3 days.
Splash cups are useful during brooding period and in hot climates.
360° activated nipples make drinking easy for chicks.
Use only 360° activated nipples for hatchery beak- treated chicks, as well as supplemental chick drinkers.

## Beak Treatment / Trimming *(Check local regulations concerning use of beak trimming)*

Hy-Line W-36 parent female is most successfully beak trimmed at hatch by infrared beak treatment or between 7-10 days
of age by precision beak trimming.
Hy-Line W-36 male should preferably not be beak trimmed. If treatment is required, beak treat in hatchery or tip at 7-10
days of age.
Females should be re-trimmed at 6 weeks or 12-14 weeks of age.
Hatchery beak treatment or 7-10-day beak trimming reduces feed wastage and leaves the beak less damaging to other birds.

## HATCHERY INFRARED BEAK TREATMENT (IRBT)

This provides efficient, uniform
beak treatment.
Beak remains intact until
10-21 days of age when
treated portion separates.
Use only 360° activated nipples
for IRBT chicks, as well as
supplemental chick drinkers.
For IRBT chicks, feed on paper
for 0-7 days.
Infrared beak treatment can be modified according to local conditions.

Use a pyrometer to measure blade temperature, which
should be approximately 650°C.
Cauterizing blade color may be used as an approximate
indicator of temperature.

## Precautions when using IRBT or beak trimming birds:

Water intake is the most important factor in the success of
IRBT/beak trimming. Chicks require immediate and easy access
to water.
Do not beak-trim sick or stressed birds.
Do not hurry; handle chicks carefully.
Provide vitamins and electrolytes containing vitamin K in
drinking water 2 days before and 2 days after beak trimming.
Watch chicks after beak trimming to assess stress. Raise
ambient temperature until birds appear comfortable and active.
Keep feed at the highest level for several days after beak
trimming.
Use only well-trained crews.
Use 360° activated nipples.
Nipple drinkers with splash cups provide additional support
for IRBT chicks.
Provide extra light on nipple drinkers after beak treatment.

## Growth and Development

Focus on pullet rearing programs to optimize growth and development.
The best predictor of future laying performance is the pullet's body weight and body type at the point of lay.
The design of the rearing facility should closely match that of the layer house to which the flock will be transferred. Drinker and feeder type and perching should match. This makes the transition of the birds from rearing to laying easy and stress-free.
A pullet flock entering into egg production at correct body weight (females 1.18-1.22 kg) with uniformity higher than 90% performs best in the production period.
It is important to achieve 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 week body weight targets to ensure optimum development of the bird's body.
If possible, exceed pullet body weight standards throughout rear.
Use a crumble starter feed to promote good feed intake.
Change rearing diets only when recommended body weights are attained.
Anticipate rapid rise in ambient temperature and adjust bird's diet accordingly. Birds will eat less when exposed to a rapid temperature increase. (See the "Understanding Heat Stress in Layers" technical update at www.hyline.com.)
Stress periods require change in diet formulation to ensure proper nutrient intake.
By 12 weeks of age, match the feeding schedule to be used in the layer house.
During the rearing period, run feeders 3-5 times per day. Feed more frequently to encourage feed intake in underweight flocks or in hot weather.
Manage feeders so that additional feedings do not create excessive fine feed particles. Check feed consumption against the body weight/feed consumption table on p. 12.
Delay diet changes if birds are underweight or have poor diet uniformity, or until after a stress-inducing event, such as catching birds for an injected vaccination.

Requirements vary with type of equipment used and environmental conditions. Density calculations should include all birds—males and females.

## Hy-Line W-36 Male Management

The W-36 male chick is smaller than the female and will benefit from a 1°C warmer brooding temperature.
The W-36 male's 18-week body weight is 1.54–1.58 kg.
The W-36 male's adult body weight is 1.95–1.99 kg (40 weeks of age).
The W-36 male should be infrared beak treated at the hatchery or tipped at 7-10 days of age.
Achieving male target body weights during rear is critical for optimum mating behavior and fertility.
Males and females should receive the same feed and lighting schedule.
For breeder cages having a specific male feeder space, these spaces should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.
Male and female breeders should reach sexual maturity at approximately the same time.
From 0-4 weeks, rear males separately to improve male body weight gain.
At 5 weeks, mix males and females. In cages, mix 3–4 females into each male cage. If males appear weaker than females, mix males with females at a 1:1 ratio through the rearing period.
Grading males into pens based on body weight can improve male uniformity.
Males and females must be co-mingled during rearing period to become socialized and avoid mating problems as adults.
Keep extra males in a separate pen; do not mix extra males with females.
Continue culling males as needed during production.
Maintain a mating ratio of 10 males for every 100 females throughout production in floor and cage systems.
Too many males results in more fighting, less mating activity and disruption of social groups and lower fertility.

## MALE EVALUATION – A BEAUTY CONTEST

*Tall, masculine appearance with full red comb* W-36 males are dubbed in the hatchery to differentiate them from females.

Evaluate males at 10 weeks and at transfer.

Cull roosters with:

Lameness
More than 200 g below target body weight
Curled toes
Foot pad lesions
Poor feathering
Poor beaks
Low social ranking
Hide in nests
Feather pecked

## Cage Systems Management

*(Use cage systems specifically designed for breeders)*

## Advantages:

Cleaner hatching eggs
Better control of enteric diseases (coccidiosis, Gumboro, internal parasites, Salmonella)
More settable eggs
Better feed efficiency; less feed waste
More efficient use of breeder house space
Lower labor costs
Lower mortality
Dry manure (less flies and ammonia)

## Disadvantages:

Higher capital investment
Less leg strength in cage-reared males
Lower fertility may occur, especially with smaller colony cages
**CAUTION** – *it is not advisable to rear breeders in cages and then transfer to a floor production system. Breeders handled in this way may experience displaced pecking behavior and poor nesting behaviors as adults.*

## Breeder Cage Enrichment

Enriched cages address some of the welfare concerns of layers in cages by providing more space with environment enrichment devices, such as perches, nest boxes, scratch areas and abrasive pads for beak and toe shortening.
As group size increases, there is more competition for feed and water space and less stable social groups. This could lead to behavioral problems like feather pecking and piling. Cage enrichments help prevent these behavioral problems.

## TRANSFER

The flock can be moved into the production facility at 15–17 weeks of age or after administration of the last live vaccines.
Males may be moved a few days earlier to the production house to give them more time to acclimate to their new environment.
It is important that rearing and production breeder cages contain similar feed and water systems.
Any sex slips should be removed around 7 weeks and at transfer.
Supportive care to reduce stress such as water-soluble vitamins, probiotics and vitamin C should be used 3 days before and 3 days after transfer.
Light intensity should increase weekly for 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house.
Light hours of rearing and laying houses should be matched at transfer.

## BREEDER HOUSE

A breeder cage designed for a colony size of 90 birds will usually have better fertility than those with smaller colony size. Smaller breeder cages with 2 or 3 males are subject to accelerated fertility loss as the flock ages.
Breeder laying cages should provide 750 cm² of floor space per bird (13 birds / m²).
Use higher bird density in environmentally controlled houses and all-slat floors and lower density on litter floors and in hot climates.
Cage should have perching and nesting areas.
Floor mesh size should be 2.54 cm x 2.54 cm.
Male feeding area should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.
Cage height should be at least 48 cm in rear and 68 cm in production to avoid males hitting their heads on the top of the cage. Males striking their heads on the top of the cage will be reluctant to mate.
Males in cage systems should be dubbed to avoid being caught in cage wires.
If mortality exceeds 0.1% / week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.
Remove mortality daily.
!\[Image description\](A diagram titled 'Colony Breeder Cage' illustrates the layout of a colony breeder cage with several sections labeled as 'Nesting area', 'Male feeding area', 'Automatic feeder' and 'Egg collection belt'.)
Breeder cages should have a specific male feeder space. These spaces should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.

## Floor Systems Management

## REARING PERIOD

Rear birds on the floor when they will be housed in floor systems during production.
Equip rearing and production houses with similar feed and water systems.
Accustom birds to humans by frequently walking through the house.
Walk through birds briskly at 2 hour intervals.
Rearing house should have elevated bird walkways with feed and water stations.
Light intensity should increase weekly for 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the layer house.
Birds moving from light-controlled rearing houses into open-sided houses should have higher light intensities the last 2 weeks of rear.
Light hours of rearing and production house should be matched at transfer.

## TRANSFER

The flock can be moved into the production facility at 15–17 weeks of age or after administration of the last live vaccines.
Place females on slats when moving to the production house.

## NEST TRAINING

Nest training is essential to minimize the number of out- of-nest eggs.
Starting the day of arrival, open nest box curtains to encourage nest exploration.
Train females to use nests by frequent walks through house in the morning for the first 8 weeks after birds are moved to the production house.
While walking, move birds away from resting areas, out of corners and toward nests.
During the first week of production, leave a few eggs in the nest to encourage females to use nests.
Quickly remove floor eggs.
Be sure all floor eggs are removed before lights go out at night.

## Nests

Nests should be dark, secluded, warm, and free of air drafts.
Ensure there is sufficient nest space (6 birds per nest or 120 hens per m² in colony nests).
Make sure nests are easy to access. Any obstructions should be removed. Feed lines should not be directly in front of nests.
Turn nest lights on 1 hour before house lights are turned on to attract females. Turn nest lights off 1 hour after house lights come on.
Discontinue nest light usage after 26 weeks of age.
False walls or partitions (perpendicular to nests and spaced every 5–7 m) may reduce overcrowding in nests.
Close nests at night.
Eliminate dark areas in the house to discourage floor eggs.
Replace worn nest floor mats.
*A good nest floor mat*:

Provides comfort for nesting female
Cushions egg to prevent damage
Keeps egg clean
Separates dirt and feathers from egg surfaces
Allows egg to roll easily to egg belt

## HOUSE MANAGEMENT

Use \< 5 cm litter depth. Litter deeper than 5 cm results in increased floor eggs.
Flocks housed in all-slat production houses should also be reared on slat or wire floors.
Use of deterrent wires on slats around house perimeter will discourage egg laying in corners or near walls. Place deterrent wires 5 cm away from the wall of the house and 10 cm above the floor. (Check local regulations regarding the use of deterrent wires.)
Deterrent wires should be activated as soon as birds are housed.
Solid perches above water and feed lines are preferred.
Feed and water lines should not block movement of females to nests.
Schedule feed lines to run as soon as birds are awake and again after most eggs have been laid.
If mortality exceeds 0.1% / week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.
Remove mortality daily.
Nests should have a staging area at the entrance to allow examination of the nests and easy access by females.

## All-Slat Breeder Houses

Drawing not to scale.

Feed and water lines should not block movement of females to nest (i.e. drinker lines too low, feeder lines too high).

\<\< Back to Table of Contents

## Perches

• Enrich birds' environment and allow expression of normal behaviors
• Allow birds to fully develop leg and breast muscles
• Encourage jumping habits which increase bone strength and calcium content of bone and will be important in good nesting behavior
• Reduce social stress by providing safe resting sites
• Increase living space in house
• Allow birds to roost at night
• May reduce piling behavior in flocks

## Perch Design

• Place perches on slats to maintain good litter conditions.
• Breeders should have access to perches by 3 weeks of age.
• Provide 10–15 cm perch space per bird (check local regulations regarding perch space).
• Separate perch rails by at least 30 cm to prevent cannibalistic pecking of birds on adjacent rails.
• Avoid slippery perches.
• Perches should be round or rectangular for better gripping and comfort.
• Perches should support bottom of foot.
• Place perches on slat to maintain good litter conditions and control floor eggs.
• If possible, use the same perch style in rear and lay houses.
• Don't use perches above water lines during rear if using deterrent over water line in production.
• Perches should be easy to clean and disinfect between flocks.
• Seal cracks, crevices and open ends of pipes to reduce hiding areas of red mites (Dermanyssus gallinae).

## Good Lighting Practices

In cage housing, measure minimum light intensity at feeder on bottom tier cages, mid-way between lights.
In floor housing, measure minimum light intensity at level of bird's head.
Keep light bulbs and bulb covers clean to prevent loss of light intensity.
Prevent dark areas caused by too much distance between lights or burned out light bulbs.
Shiny or white surfaces reflect light and increase light intensity.
Take local conditions into account which may require adaptations of lighting programs.
Light hours of rearing and production houses should be matched at transfer.
Light intensity should increase 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house (but not prior to 14 weeks of age). Final rearing house light intensity should match the laying house intensity.
Light stimulation period should extend into the peaking period (achieve 16 hours of light at approximately 25 weeks).

## Light Program for Light-Controlled Housing (www.hyline.com)

Hy-Line W-36 breeders require a slower step-down of light hours from 0–11 weeks to prevent early sexual maturity and promote good body weight uniformity.

Light-controlled houses are those which use light traps around fans and air inlets and complete prevent the ingress of light from the outside. Houses that are not light controlled should use lighting programs for open-sided housing.
An intermittent lighting program for chicks is preferred. If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0-7 days, then use 22 hours of light from 0-3 days and 21 hours of light from 4-7 days.
"Lights on" time can be varied between houses in laying flocks to facilitate egg collection on multiple flock complexes.
If the laying flock has a large spread in hatch ages and/or poor uniformity, light stimulate the flock based on the youngest hatch date or lightest birds.
Use warm lights (2700-3500 K) in laying flocks to ensure sufficient red spectrum light.

## Customized Lighting Programs for Open-Sided Housing (www.hyline.com)

The Hy-Line International Lighting Program can create custom lighting programs for your location. To prevent early sexual development, the program finds the longest natural day length between 12-17 weeks of age and constructs an artificial lighting program that holds day length constant with artificial lights from 12-17 weeks.

## HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK

## Lighting Considerations

## FLOOR

Light intensity in house should be brightest over feeding and resting areas and gradually decrease toward nests.
Avoid dark areas near feeding and resting areas to prevent floor eggs.
!\[Image description\](Illustration of poultry house with lights above resting areas. Labels indicate litter/scratch areas and slats.)

## CAGES

Alternating the height of lights improves light distribution to all cage levels.
Position lights to minimize bright and dark areas in the house.
!\[Image description\](Illustration of poultry cage with lights above each cage level.)

## Use of Shades in Open-Sided Housing

!\[Image description\](Two photographs of poultry houses with shades.)
Shades are an effective way to decrease light intensity in an open-sided house.
Keep shades clean and free of dust to allow air flow.
Use stir fans when using shades.
Avoid direct sunlight on birds by using shades or roof overhangs.
Black shades are preferred.

## Midnight Feeding / Lighting Program

Optional lighting technique that promotes greater feed consumption
Used whenever more feed intake is desired in rearing or laying flocks
Increases calcium absorption during night when most egg shell is formed
Useful to increase feed intake during peak egg production
Helps maintain feed consumption in hot climates
Midnight feeding may increase feed intake 2-5 g / day per bird

## Good Practices

Initiate the program by turning lights on for 1-2 hours in the middle of the dark period.
There must be at least 3 hours of dark before and after the midnight feeding.
Fill feeders before lights are turned on.
Light provided during the midnight feeding is in addition to regular day length (i.e. 16 hours + midnight feeding).
If midnight feeding is removed, reduce light gradually at a rate of 15 minutes per week.

## Management Events for Breeders

## AGES OF BODY WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS

Arrival • Check body weights.

0-3 weeks • Bulk weigh 10 boxes of 10 chicks.

4-29 weeks • Weigh 100 birds individually every week. • If caged, weigh birds in the same cages each time for best accuracy. • Calculate uniformity.

30-50 weeks • Weigh 100 birds individually every 5 weeks. • If caged, weigh birds in the same cages each time for best accuracy. • Calculate uniformity.

Over 50 weeks • Weigh 100 birds individually every 10 weeks. • If caged, weigh birds in the same cages each time for best accuracy. • Calculate uniformity.

## CALCULATING UNIFORMITY

• Use individual bird weights. • Uniformity calculation tool is available at www.hylinebodyweight.com.

When handling birds for body weights, assess: • Keel bone—straightness and firmness • Breast muscle score • Body fat • External parasites • Clinical symptoms of disease

## AGES OF SERA COLLECTION

For more information, see the "Proper Collection and Handling of Diagnostic Samples" technical update at www.hyline.com.

Collect 25 sera samples per flock for titer determination.

8 weeks • Assess early vaccination technique and disease exposure for IB, NDV, MG, MS, IBD.

14-16 weeks or at transfer • Verify that the flock is antibody negative for *Salmonella pullorum*. • Verify flock is antibody positive for CAV and AE; if negative, revaccinate and retest until positive (do not use hatching eggs until flock is antibody positive). • Assess possible change in disease exposure.

24 weeks • Collect sera at least 4 weeks after final inactivated vaccination to measure post-vaccination antibody response. • It is useful to assess response to inactivated vaccine and / or disease challenge after transfer to lay farm.

## AGES OF FERTILITY CHECKS

## Bird Handling—BE GENTLE

• Proper handling of birds during body weight measurements, blood collection, selection, vaccination, and transfer will reduce bird stress and prevent injuries. • Hold birds by both legs or both wings. • Return birds to floor or cage gently. • Use experienced personnel that have been trained in proper procedures of bird handling. • Continually observe crews for proper handling.

Hold no more than three birds in one hand.

Correct way to hold birds when placing or removing from cage.

## Hatching Egg Care

Hy-Line W-36 hatching eggs should weigh a minimum of
50 g from a flock at least 22 weeks of age.
Eggs from younger flocks may be used, realizing that
chick size and early livability will not be optimum.
Hatch profiles should be optimized based on egg size.
Hatching eggs should be gathered a minimum of twice
daily and more frequently during extremely hot weather.
Eggs should be in cool storage within 6 hours of laying.
Eggs should be stored at 15-18°C with relative humidity
of 70-80%.
When necessary to save eggs longer than 10 days, store
at 13°C with 70-80% humidity or use SPIDES program.
For more information, see the "SPIDES" technical update
at www.hyline.com.
Best hatches result from eggs 3-7 days of age.
Store hatching eggs with air cell up (pointed end down).
Use only eggs laid in nests for hatching.
Do not use dirty, cracked or malformed eggs for hatching.
Grade eggs on breeder farm to prevent bringing
contaminated eggs to the hatchery.
Hatching eggs should be sanitized using products
specifically developed for this purpose.
It is extremely important that once eggs are cooled,
they are stored at a temperature that does not allow
condensation (moisture forming on shell due to exposure
to warm humid air).
The truck taking hatching eggs from farm cooler to
hatchery should be capable of keeping eggs cool to avoid
condensation.
!\[Image description\](Unacceptable hatching eggs are dirty, bloody, misshappen, thin-shelled, cracked, or outside the acceptable weight range.)

## Fertility Check

## FRESH EGG BREAKOUT 72 HOUR INCUBATION FERTILITY CHECK

!\[Image description\](Fertile Egg
Blastoderm is always round
(doughnut shaped), 4-5 mm)
!\[Image description\](Infertile Egg

Fertility checks on fresh eggs can be done to identify cages with low fertility. Poor quality males should be removed and replaced with reserve males.

!\[Image description\](Place hatching eggs onto hatcher trays shortly after arrival at the hatchery. This improves ventilation and proper cooling of eggs for cool storage. Disinfect hatcher trays before placing eggs into cool room.)
\<\< Back to Table of Contents

## Incubation and Hatching

• Pre-warm hatching eggs to achieve maximum chick yield and uniformity of hatch time.

Warm up eggs to a room temperature of 23-25°C and 55% humidity for 8 to 12 hours.

Provide adequate air movement in pre-warming area to reduce condensation and provide uniform temperature to all eggs.

In single-stage incubator, use pre-warm setting.

• Under normal conditions Hy-Line W-36 eggs achieve optimum hatch in 21 days and 18 hours.

• Egg age affects hatch time. Allow 1 additional hour of incubation for every day beyond 10 days of egg age.

• Chick weight at hatch is directly related to the weight of the hatching egg, usually approximately 66% of egg weight.

• Eggs should be grouped in setter according to parent source flock. Maintain these groups so similar size chicks may be placed together in the brooder house.

## Feather Sexing

HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK Hy-Line W-36 commercial chicks are sexable by their wing feathers. The female commercial chicks show fast feathering (primary wing feathers are longer and thicker than the covert feathers) and male commercial chicks are slow feathering (primary and covert feathers are the same length and thickness). In a small percentage of male chicks covert feathers may be longer than the primary feathers (super slow feathering).

Goal: Sexing errors less than 0.5% The tip of the wing is used for feather sexing

| Primaries | Coverts | Primaries | Coverts | Coverts | Primaries |
| --------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Fast feathering = female chick Sight: Coverts are shorter than primaries Feel: Coverts are thin and primaries are thick | Slow feathering = male chick Sight: Coverts and primaries are short and same height Feel: Coverts and primaries same thickness | | Super slow feathering = male chick Sight: Coverts are longer than primary feathers Feel: Coverts and primaries same thickness Occurs in a small number of chicks | | |

## Controlling Egg Weight

* Monitor egg weight weekly throughout the life of the flock. \* Egg-weight control is achieved by limiting amino acid and energy consumption. \* Start controlling egg weight when the average egg weight is within 2 g of the target. \* Excessively large hatching eggs are associated with lower hatchability and chick numbers.

## Control of Ambient House Temperature

* At housing, an ambient temperature of 18-20°C is desired. Increase house temperature about 1°C every 2 weeks until reaching 25°C, assuming ventilation systems are able to maintain adequate air quality at these temperatures. \* Lower (colder) house temperatures will lead to greater feed intakes and may be counterproductive to egg-weight control, as well as optimal feed efficiency and adult hen body weights.

'Do not feed Pre-Lay Diet earlier than 15 weeks of age. Do not feed Pre-Lay later than first egg as it contains insufficient calcium to support egg production. Implementing a pre-lay diet can be challenging in mixed-age flocks. If it's not possible to use the Pre- Lay diet, the calcium content of the last stage rearing diet (developer) must be increased to 1.4%. ² Recommended energy range is based on raw material energy values shown in feed ingredient table at back of this guide. It is important that target concentrations of dietary energy are adjusted according to energy system applied to raw material matrix. ³ Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed. ⁴ Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only. ⁵ Calcium should be supplied as fine calcium carbonate (mean particle size less than 2 mm). Coarse limestone (2-4 mm) can be introduced in Pre-Lay Diet at up to 50% of total limestone. \* Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus. ⁷ Oil levels can be increased to 2.0% in starter diets when given as a mash to control dust and increase feed palatability.

## Pre-Lay Ration

* Plan to feed for a maximum of 10–14 days before point of lay.

* Feed when most pullets show reddening of combs.

* It is important to increase medullary bone reserves.

* Begin introducing large particle calcium in Pre-Lay Diet.

* Discontinue pre-lay feeding with the commencement of egg production.

## Transition Period

* Occurring during the transition period: – Rapidly increasing egg production – Increasing egg size – Increasing body weight \* Feed consumption may increase slowly during transition: – In underweight birds – In flocks lacking uniformity – During high environmental temperatures \* Poor uniformity prolongs the transition period and may result in low peak and poor persistency of egg production.

* Monitor feed intake carefully during transition and adjust dietary nutrient concentration according to actual feed intakes.

## Peaking Ration

* Formulations for low feed intakes (77–88 g/ day per bird) should be given as the flock enters egg production to better meet nutrient requirements.

* Begin Peaking Diet with onset of lay (1% egg production).

* Ensure that Peaking Diet is in the feeders when first eggs are laid, not in the feed bin.

* Birds should continue to grow during peaking period. Poor nutrition during this period can lead to loss of body weight and soft bones.

* Feed intake may be reduced if birds are not accustomed to extra large particle calcium (i.e. not using a Pre-Lay Diet).

* Monitor keel bone development during the peaking period. For more information on keel bone scoring, see the "Understanding the Role of the Skeleton in Egg Production" technical update at www.hyline.com.

* Hy-Line W-36 breeders require early egg weight control through nutrition; egg weight can increase rapidly if uncontrolled.

¹ All nutrient requirements are based on the feed ingredient table at the back of this guide. ² Crude protein, methionine+cystine, fat, linoleic acid, and / or energy may be changed to optimize egg size. ³ Peaking nutrient levels are calculated for birds at peak egg production. Prior to achieving peak egg production, the nutrient requirements will be lower. ⁴ A good approximation of the influence of temperature on energy needs is that for each 0.5°C change higher or lower than 22°C, subtract or add about 1.8 kcal/bird/day, respectively. ⁵ Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized lleal Digestible AminoAcids must be followed. ⁶ Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is anestimated typical value only. ⁷ Calcium and available phosphorus requirements are determined by flock age. When production remains higher and diets are fed for longer than ages shown, it is recommended to increaseto calcium and phosphorus concentrations of next feeding phase. ⁸ Calcium carbonate particle size recommendation varies throughout lay. Refer to Calcium Particle Size Table. Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility. ⁹ Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.

The general rule for determining required fan capacity—4 m³ of air movement / kilogram of body weight per hour.
Ventilation is essential to:
Remove moisture from house
Remove excessive heat
Provide each bird with an adequate supply of oxygen
Remove carbon dioxide produced by birds
Remove dust particles
Dilute aerosolized pathogenic organisms
Allowable levels of gases at floor level in the house are: ammonia (NH₂) \< 25 ppm; carbon dioxide (CO₂) \< 5000 ppm; carbon monoxide (CO) \< 50 ppm.

## Calcium Particle Size

| PARTICLE SIZE | STARTER, GROWER, DEVELOPER | PRE-LAY | WEEKS 17-36 | WEEKS 37-52 | WEEKS 53+ |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Fine (0-2 mm) | 100% | 50% | 50% | 40% | 35% |
| Coarse (2-4 mm) | - | 50% | 50% | 60% | 65% |

Appropriate particle size depends on the solubility of limestone.
Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility.
Limestone dark in color is geologically older, containing more impurities (typically magnesium) and is generally lower in solubility and calcium availability.
Oyster shell and other marine shells are good sources of soluble calcium.

\<\< Back to Table of Contents

• Use on the farm to check feed particle size from the feed mill—sample taken on delivery or from feed bins.
• Use to assess the uniformity of feed particle size throughout the feeding system—samples are taken from various points.
Too many fine feed particles:

• Feed intake and nutrient absorption decreases
• Dust in house increases
Too many coarse feed particles:

• Birds selectively eat large particles
• Risk of feed separation increases

For more information, see Feed Granulometry.

## Best Practices

• A 3-4 hour gap in mid-day feedings allows birds to consume fine particles.
• Add a minimum of 0.5% liquid oil / fat in meal diets to incorporate and retain small particles in feed.
• Use larger particle size meal or crumble to increase intakes in hot climates.

## Vitamins and Trace Minerals

As the vitamin/trace mineral premix is often found in fine feed particles, a minimum level of 1% added liquid oil/ fat in diets binds small particles in feed.

## Water Quality

• Water is the most important nutrient. Good quality water must be available to birds at all times. • Water and feed consumption are directly related—when birds drink less, they consume less feed and production quickly declines. • As a general rule, healthy birds will consume 1.5-2.0 times more water than feed. This ratio increases in high ambient temperatures. • Test water quality at least 1 time per year. The water source will determine the regularity of water testing. Surface water requires more frequent testing, as it is more affected by season and rainfall patterns. Closed wells taking water from aquifers or deep artesian basins will be more consistent in water quality, but are generally higher in dissolved mineral content. • The presence of coliform bacteria is an indicator that the water source has been contaminated with animal or human waste.

## HY-LINE W-36 PARENT STOCK

• When collecting a well water sample, let the water run for 2 minutes prior to collecting the sample. Water samples should be kept below 10°C and submitted to the lab in less than 24 hours. Some water sources contain high levels of dissolved minerals such as calcium, sodium and magnesium. When this occurs, amounts of these minerals in water have to be considered when formulating feed. • Ideal water pH is 5-7 to promote good water sanitation, increase feed consumption and improve upper gastrointestinal health. • Less than optimum water quality can have a significant impact on intestinal health, which will lead to under utilization of nutrients in feed. • Reduced flock water consumption is often the first sign of health problems and production drops.

## Disease Control

A flock of pullets or layers can only perform up to its genetic potential when disease influence is minimized. The diseases of economic importance vary widely between locations, but in every case the challenge is to identify and control those diseases.

## Biosecurity

Biosecurity is the best method of avoiding diseases. A good biosecurity program identifies and controls the most likely ways a disease could enter the farm.

Human and equipment movement onto the farm should be strictly controlled.
Visitors to the farm should be limited to those essential for its operation.
Visits should be documented in a logbook.
All visitors and workers should shower at a central location before entering.
Clean boots, clothing and head cover should be provided for workers and visitors.

Clean footbaths containing disinfectant should be placed outside entries to all poultry houses.
If possible, avoid using outside crews or equipment for vaccination, moving, and beak trimming.
Ideally, workers should be limited to a single house.
For those visiting a number of flocks, flocks visited on one day should be limited. Always progress from younger to older and from healthy to sick flocks. After visiting a sick flock, no other houses should be entered.
Removal of flocks from the farm is an opportunity for disease to be introduced, as trucks and crews have often been on other farms.
A single-aged rearing farm using an all-in, all-out principle is best to prevent transmission of disease from older flocks to younger, susceptible flocks.
Houses should be designed to prevent exposure to wild birds, insects and rodents.
Quickly and properly dispose of dead chickens.

## Rodents

Rodents are known carriers of many poultry diseases and the most common reason for re-contamination of a cleaned and disinfected poultry facility. They are also responsible for house-to-house spread of disease on a farm.

The farm should be free of debris and tall grass that provide a hiding area for rodents.
The perimeter of each house should have a 1 m wide area of crushed rock or concrete to prevent rodents from burrowing into the house.
Feed and eggs should be stored in rodent-proof areas.
Bait stations should be placed throughout the house and maintained with fresh rodenticide.

## Cleaning and Disinfection

Cleaning and disinfection of the house between flocks reduces infection pressure for the next flock.

Allow a minimum of 2 weeks downtime between flocks.
All feed and manure should be removed from the house before cleaning.
Thoroughly clean air inlets, fan housing, fan blades and fan louvers.
Heating the house during washing improves the removal of organic matter.
The house should be cleaned of organic matter with a high-pressure spray of warm water.
Use foam / gel detergent to soak into organic matter and equipment.
Wash the upper portion of the house before the pit.
Use high pressure warm water to rinse.
Allow the house to dry.
After it is fully dry, apply foam / spray disinfectant followed by fumigation.
Flush and sanitize water lines.
Monitoring of poultry houses for presence of *Salmonella*, particularly *Salmonella enteritidis*, by routine environmental testing is recommended.
Allow the house to dry before repopulating.

## Vertically Transmitted Diseases

Some diseases are known to be transmitted from infected breeders to progeny.

Disease-free breeders are the first step in control of these diseases for commercial layers.
All breeders directly under Hy-Line International's control are free of lymphoid leukosis, *Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, Salmonella pullorum, Salmonella gallinarum, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium* and other *Salmonella* species.
Due to the possibility of horizontal transmission of these diseases, later generations may not remain free.
It is the responsibility of breeding and commercial flock owners to prevent horizontal transmission of these diseases and to continue testing to be assured of a negative status.

## COCCIDIA

This parasitic infection of the intestines may lead to gut damage and, in severe infestations, death. More commonly, poor control of sub-clinical infection reduces feed conversion or leaves pullets with chronic, irreversible gut damage. Pullet flocks may be uneven or underweight at housing and not perform to their full potential in lay. Control of coccidia includes the following measures (check local regulations):

Use ionophores or chemicals on a step-down program to ensure immunity in pullets.
Live vaccine use is an alternative to anti-coccidial drug treatments.
Live vaccines are available that can be administered by spray in the hatchery or by feed or water application during the first few days in the brooder house.
Control of flies and beetles, which are vectors of coccidial spread.
Thorough cleaning and disinfection of houses reduces challenge pressure.
Maintenance of dry litter reduces coccidia oocyst sporulation.

## Vaccination Recommendations

## Vaccination

Certain diseases are too widespread or difficult to eradicate and require a routine vaccination program. In general, all layer flocks should be vaccinated against Marek's disease, Newcastle disease (NDV), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD or Gumboro), chicken anemia virus (CAV), avian encephalomyelitis (AE) and fowl pox. Other vaccinations are added to the program as local disease challenges dictate.

A single program cannot be recommended for all regions. Follow label instructions provided by the vaccine manufacturer. Use only approved vaccines. Consult with local veterinarians to determine the best vaccination program for your area.
