Others take the contents more se- riously and expect frequent updates to find specific data which apply to the current gen- eration of layers and current management practices. Newcomers in the business may need more detailed explanations than can be presented in this compact format. We hope that each reader will find some use- ful information, to confirm proven manage- ment practices or to stimulate improvements.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A black and white photograph of a chicken standing on the ground.)\n\n## TOP PERFORMANCE BY SYSTEMATIC SELECTION\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a group of chicken, representing poultry management.)\nLOHMANN – the right partner for progressive, successful poultry management.\n\nIn recent decades, advanced methods have significantly improved breeding quality.

In summer start heating at least\n> 24 hours and in winter at least 48 hours\n> before the chicks arrive. When the right\n> temperature has been achieved, supply\n> minimum ventilation. This will avoid tem-\n> perature differences within the house.\n> Maintain the recommended temperatures\n> (35-36 °C) during the first 48-72 hours.\n> Relative humidity should be at least 60%.\n> The right height of the drinkers must be\n> adjusted to allow the chicks to drink water\n> without difficulty.\n> Reduce the water pressure of the nipples\n> in order to enable the chicks to find water\n> easily.\n> Keep drinking water temperature be-\n> tween 20-25 °C by temporarily flushing\n> the nipple drinker lines or renewing the\n> water in the chick founts.\n> Follow the recommended lighting pro-\n> grammes (refer to page 26).\n\n## Cage Systems\n\n> Adjust the cage floors and feeding grids\n> according to the manufacturer's instruc-\n> tions.\n> Place sheets of paper on the cage floor\n> for the first days and distribute a bit of\n> feed on this paper. The papers must be\n> removed by day 7.\n> Unload all chick boxes and distribute them\n> in the house. Remove all lids and place\n> them on the top of the boxes.\n> Quickly place the chicks near feeders\n> and drinkers. Distribute the chicks evenly\n> among the cages starting at the far end of\n> the house.\n> Trigger nipples/water cups to encourage\n> birds to drink.\n\n## Floor Systems\n\n> Before arrival of the chicks, litter should\n> be spread only after heating the house,\n> when the floor has reached the optimum\n> temperature. Softwood shavings or straw\n> make suitable litter.\n> After arrival, place chicks under brooders\n> as soon as possible.\n> Measure the brooder temperature by plac-\n> ing the thermometer 8 cm inside the outer\n> edge of the brooder and 8 cm above the\n> litter.\n> Dip the beaks of a few chicks into water\n> and trigger nipple or water cups to help\n> them start drinking. When drinking water\n> has been found by all chicks (this will take\n> approx. 2-3 hours), they will start to eat.\n> Supply the chicks with additional feeding\n> bowls to ensure a better feed intake in the\n> first few days.\n> Chicks should be fully feathered before\n> brooding equipment has to be removed.\n\n## Body Temperature of the Chicks\n\nThe body temperature of housed chicks is a very useful indicator to adjust house tem- perature in an optimum way. A simple tool to measure the body temperature of day old chicks is usage of modern ear thermometers, known from human medicine. The correct application to measure the body tempera- ture is just to touch the cloaca gently with the thermometer probe. The optimal body temperature of the chicks is about 40 to 41 °C.\n\nObtain samples of the chicks distributed in different parts of the house in order to have reliable results. Proceed in a way you nor- mally do while weighing chicks/pullets to check their uniformity. Collect the informa- tion, calculate the average and adjust house temperature accordingly to achieve optimal chick temperatures. For example increase the house temperature by 0.5 °C, if the av- erage body temperature of the chicks is 39.5 °C.\n\nBesides house temperature, there are other factors which could affect the body temper- ature of the chicks negatively:\n\n> Insufficient air distribution in the house\n> Low humidity level (heat transfer capacity of the air)\n> Missing to pre-warm the house at the right time\n> After a few hours, check whether the chicks have settled down well. The chicks behav- iour is the best indicator of their well-being:\n\n> If the chicks are evenly spread out and moving freely, temperature and ventila- tion are all right.\n> If the chicks are crowding together or avoiding certain areas within the house, temperature is too low or there is a draught.\n> If the chicks are lying about on the floor with outspread wings and gasping for air, temperature is too high.\n> !\\[Image description\\](A photo of a person using an ear thermometer on a small chick.)\n> At first signs that the chicks are not feeling well determine the reason, correct the situa- tion and check more frequently.\n\n## ENVIRONMENT\n\nEnvironmental conditions have an effect on the well-being and performance of the birds. Important environmental factors are tem-perature, humidity and level of toxic gases in the air. The optimal temperature depends on the age of the birds. The following table is a guide to the correct temperature at bird lev- el. As mentioned before, the birds behaviour is the best indicator for correct temperature. Always reduce temperature gradually, and avoid sudden changes. If the ventilation system is used to regulate temperature, take care that the necessary fresh air is supplied.\n\n| Age | Temperature °C |\n| --- | -------------- |\n| Day 1-2\\* | 35–36 |\n| Day 3–4 | 33–34 |\n| Day 5–7 | 31–32 |\n| Week 2 | 28–29 |\n| Week 3 | 26–27 |\n| Week 4 | 22–24 |\n| From Week 5 | 18–20 |\n\n* Body temperatures of 40–41 °C are the optimum for the chicks.\n\nThe relative humidity inside the house should be about 60–70 %.\n\nThe air quality should meet the following minimum requirements:\n\n| | | |\n| - | - | - |\n| O₂ | over | 20% |\n| CO 2 | under | 0.3% |\n| CO | under | 40 ppm |\n| NH 3 | under | 20 ppm |\n| H₂S | under | 5 ppm |\n\n## VACCINATION\n\n## General Recommendations\n\nVaccination is an important way of prevent- ing diseases. Different regional epidemic sit- uations require suitably adapted vaccination programmes. Therefore, please be guided, by the advice of your local veterinarian and poultry health service. Only healthy flocks should be vaccinated. Check the expiration date of the vaccine. The vaccine must not be used after this date. Keep records of all vac- cinations and vaccine serial numbers.\n\n## Vaccination Methods\n\nIndividual Vaccinations such as injections and eye-drops are very effective and gener- ally well tolerated but also very labour inten- sive.\n\nDrinking Water Vaccinations are not la- bour intensive but must be carried out with the greatest care to be effective. The water used for preparing the vaccine solution must not contain any disinfectants. During the growing period, the birds should be with- out water for approximately 2 hours prior to vaccination. During hot weather reduce this time accordingly. The amount of vaccine solution should be calculated for complete consumption within 2–4 hours. When vac- cinating with live vaccines, add 2g of skim milk powder per litre of water or canned milk in order to protect the virus titre, if no water stabilisator is available.\n\nSpray Vaccinations are not labour intensive and are highly effective, but may occasion ally have side effects. For chicks up to the age of 3 weeks apply only coarse spray. Use dis- tilled water for vaccination.\n\n## Special Recommendations\n\nMarek Re-Vaccinations have proved to be successful after long transportation and in areas with high infection risk. Consult your veterinarian and the LOHMANN Technical Service Team for further information.\n\nMycoplasmosis Vaccinations are only advisable if the farm cannot be kept free of mycoplasmosis. Infections with virulent mycoplasma species during the produc- tion period lead to performance depression. The best performance is achieved by flocks which are kept free of mycoplasmosis and are not vaccinated.\n\nVaccination against Coccidiosis is the most reliable method in the floor rearing to develop immunity against this disease. Never use coccidiostats in the feed when pullets are vaccinated.\n\nApplying Vitamins in the first two to three days after vaccination can help to reduce stress and prevent undesired reactions. To what extent depends on the specific situa- tion on each farm.\n\n## VACCINATION\n\n## Table 3: Example of a Vaccination Programme for LOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC Layers\n\n| Disease | Occurrence - World- wide | Occurrence - Locally | Application Methods | Remarks |\n| ------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |\n| Marek | • | | SC–IM | Day 1–Hatchery |\n| Newcastle \\* | • | | DW–SP–SC–IM | Number of vaccinations ac- cording to disease pressure |\n| Gumboro | • | | DW | 2 live vaccinations recom- mended |\n| Infectious Bronchitis \\* | • | | DW–SP–SC–IM | Number of vaccinations ac- cording to disease pressure |\n| AE | • | | DW–SC–WW | Vaccination of PS and Com- mercials is recommended |\n| Mycoplasmosis | | • | SP–ED–SC–IM | Vaccination before transfer |\n| Fowl Pox | | • | WW | Vaccination before transfer |\n| Pasteurellosis | | • | SC | 2 vaccinations approx. at week 8 and 14 |\n| Infectious Coryza | | • | SC | 2 vaccinations approx. at week 8 and 14 |\n| Salmonella | • | | DW–SP–IM | Vaccination before transfer |\n| ILT | | • | DW–ED | 2 vaccinations between 6–14 weeks |\n| EDS | | • | SC–IM | Vaccination before transfer |\n\nDW: Drinking Water WW: Wing Web SP: Spray IM: Intramuscular Injection ED: Eye Drop SC: Subcutaneous Injection Vaccination against Coccidiosis is optional for floor rearing systems \\* An implementation of early live vaccination for Newcastle Disease (ND) and Infectious Bronchitis (IB) is of high value in order to induce local protection in the respiratory system of the chicks (priming effect). The right choice of vaccine is crucial. Never vaccinate very young birds with high-virulence live vaccine. Depending on infectious pressure, birds are vaccinated with inactivated vaccine during the rearing and/or prior onset of lay for booster the immunity. Revaccination with live ND and/or IB every 6–8 weeks during production period is beneficial in order to improve the local immunity.\n\nA severe vaccination programme especially intramuscular injections may depress the body weight development.\n\n## BEAK TREATMENT\n\nBeak treatment is not necessary under opti- mal conditions. In practice, it is widely used in environmental controlled and light-tight facilities, as an efficient precaution against cannibalism and feather pecking. Such be- haviour may develop at any age as a result of excessive light intensity, unbalanced feed, poor ventilation, overstocking or boredom. Especially in floor management and/or open houses with uncontrollable light intensity, we recommend beak treatment subject to local animal welfare regulations. A very gentle and highly recommended method of beak treat- ment is the infrared treatment of the upper and lower beak by means of a special tech- nique, performed shortly after chicks hatch. This procedure can already be done in the hatchery under very hygienic conditions by specially trained personnel. Another method of beak treatment is to treat the beaks with a hot blade.\n\nUse only equipment and blades in perfect working order; adjust the blade tempera- ture so that cauterisation is guaranteed and the beak is not damaged.\nAdjust temperature and duration of the treatment according to the chicks beak size, strength and quality.\n\n## Observe the following pre- cautions for a conventional beak treatment:\n\nDo not feed for 12 hours before treating.\nTreat only healthy, unstressed birds, at the age of 7-10 days.\nOffer free feeding immediately after treating.\nAllow only experienced personnel to do the work.\nIncrease the level of feed in the troughs.\nWork slowly and carefully.\nIncrease the temperature in the house for a few days after treating.\nFor 3–5 days after beak treating provide an extra hour of light and supply feed in the late evening or at night.\nGiving vitamins via the drinking water can also help to alleviate stress.\n\n## NUTRITION\n\n## General\n\nTo get the best out of the genetic perfor- mance potential of LOHMANN BROWN- CLASSIC layers, feeding them with a good structured mash feed with full nutritive value is a must. Such nutrition can best be guar- anteed by a complete feed adapted to the performance potential. Our feeding recommendations concentrate on the essential nutrients and are designed to cover the requirements for the best per- formance in every stage of development.\n\n## Ad Libitum Feed Supply\n\nLOHMANN Layers and their breeders are specialised birds selected for a high egg pro- duction. Because of their high turnover rates “feed into food”, they have a big demand for nutrients. Layers in full production convert roughly one third of the consumed nutrients into eggs. There is no danger in wasting feed by sup- plying feed ad libitum, because the hens can adjust their intake to the nutrient density of the feed. But there is a real danger in restrict- ing birds in feed intake. An undersupply of nutrients will harm the birds. They lose pro- duction and once exhausted, they easily can run into a health problem.\n\n## Feed Consumption\n\nFeed consumption is mainly affected by:\n\n> Body weight\n> Performance\n> House temperature: Low temperature in- creases the maintenance requirement for energy.\n> Condition of feathering: Poor feathering condition due to management mistakes or malnutrition increases the maintenance requirement for energy.\n> Feed texture: Coarse texture increases while fine texture decreases feed intake.\n> Energy level: The higher the energy level of the feed, the lower the feed intake and vice versa.\n> Nutrient imbalances: The hen will try to compensate for any nutrient deficits by increasing feed consumption especially in the latest age of production.\n\n## Table 4: Body Weight Development with Standard Lighting Programme of LOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC Pullets/Layers\n\n| Age in Weeks | Body Weight (g) - Average | Body Weight (g) - Range | Feed\\* |\n| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |\n| 1 | 75 | 73-77 | |\n| 2 | 130 | 126-134 | |\n| 3 | 195 | 189-201 | |\n| 4 | 273 | 265-281 | |\n| 5 | 366 | 355-377 | Grower / Starter |\n| 6 | 469 | 455-483 | |\n| 7 | 573 | 556-590 | |\n| 8 | 677 | 657-697 | |\n| 9 | 777 | 754-800 | |\n| 10 | 873 | 847-899 | |\n| 11 | 963 | 934-992 | |\n| 12 | 1047 | 1016-1078 | Developer |\n| 13 | 1128 | 1094-1162 | |\n| 14 | 1205 | 1169-1241 | |\n| 15 | 1279 | 1241-1317 | |\n| 16 | 1351 | 1310-1392 | |\n| 17 | 1421 | 1378-1464 | |\n| 18 | 1493 | 1448-1538 | |\n| 19 | 1565 | 1518-1612 | Pre- Layer |\n\nDue to starvation before and during transport, weight losses of up to 15 % of body weight may occur. \\*The basis of switching between diet types is the hen’s body weight development. The correct time for switching the diet is determined not by age but by body weight. Chicks and pullets should therefore be weighed at regular intervals. Chicks / pullets at all times should be supplied ad libitum with feed. Never limit feed intake!\n\n## NUTRITION\n\n| Diet type\\* | Starter \\*\\* Week 1–3 | Grower Week 1–8 | Developer Week 9–17 | Pre-Layer Week 18–5 % prod. |\n| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| Nutrient | | | | |\n| Metabol.

The correct time for changing the diet is determined not by age, but by body weight. Chicks and pullets, should therefore be weighed at regular intervals. \\*\\* Chicks should be fed starter feed, if the standard body weight is not reached by feeding grower feed or if the daily feed intake is expected to be (too) low. without adding phytase\n\n## Nutrition and Egg Weight\n\nWithin certain limits egg weight can be adapted to farm specific requirements by adjusting rations. The following nutritional factors should be noted:\n\n> Growing\n> Feeding for higher body weight/frame size increases the egg weight through- out the whole laying period.\n> Feed composition\n> crude protein and methionine\n> linoleic acid\n> Feeding technique\n> feed texture\n> feeding time\n> feed level in troughs\n> controlled feeding\n> frequency of feeding\n> By stimulating feed intake egg weight can be increased and limited by controlled feed- ing. In the case of appropriate house con- struction, there's the possibility to adjust the house temperature in the opposite direction of desired egg weight and feed intake.\n\nContact your LOHMANN specialists for spe- cific programmes with recommendations for nutrition and management adjusted to your conditions and requirements.\n\n| Table 6: Recommended Particle-Size Distribution for Chick Starter, Grower, Developer and Layer Feed (MASH) | Sieve Size | Passing Part | Sieve Size Interval | Part of Interval |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- |\n| | 0.5 mm | 19% | 0-0.5 mm | 19% |\n| | 1.0 mm | 40% | 0.51-1.0 mm | 21% |\n| | 1.5 mm | 75% | 1.01-1.5 mm | 35% |\n| | 2.0 mm | 90% | 1.51-2.0 mm | 15% |\n| | 2.5 mm | 100% | \\> 2 mm | 10%\\* |\n| | | | | 100% |\n\n* Individual Particles not bigger than: \\> 3 mm in chick superstarter-/starter diets \\> 5 mm in grower, developer and layer The above table should be understood as an example for a homogenous mash feed structure. Different technique in feed production may lead to different particle sizes and variation. The overall target for mash feed structure needs to be optimal homogeneity. Mash feed with \"some finer\" or \"some coarser\" structure will be optimal as well, as long the structure ensures optimal homogeneity. Variation in feed structure from batch to batch and within different feed delive- ries should be as low as possible. A minimum amount of added fat and/or oil supports homogeneity and palatability of mash feed in the rearing and laying phase.\n\n## NUTRITION\n\n| Supplements per kg Feed | Starter/Grower | Developer | Pre-Layer/Layer |\n| ----------------------- | -------------- | --------- | --------------- |\n| Vitamin A\\* | I.U. | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 |\n| Vitamin D, | I.U. | 2000 | 2000 | 2500 |\n| Vitamin E | mg | 20-30\\*\\*\\* | 20-30\\*\\*\\* | 15-30\\*\\*\\* |\n| Vitamin K, | mg | 3\\*\\*\\*\\* | 3\\*\\*\\*\\* | 3\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| Vitamin B, | mg | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Vitamin B₂ | mg | 6 | 6 | 4 |\n| Vitamin B | mg | 3 | 3 | 3 |\n| Vitamin B₁₂ | mcg | 20 | 20 | 25 |\n| Pantothenic Acid | mg | 8 | 8 | 10 |\n| Nicotinic Acid | mg | 30 | 30 | 30 |\n| Folic Acid | mg | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.5 |\n| Biotin | mcg | 50 | 50 | 50 |\n| Cholin | mg | 300 | 300 | 400 |\n| Antioxydant | mg | 100-150\\*\\*\\* | 100-150\\*\\*\\* | 100-150\\*\\*\\* |\n| Coccidiostat | as required | as required | | |\n| Manganese\\*\\* | mg | 100 | 100 | 100 |\n| Zinc\\*\\* | mg | 60 | 60 | 60 |\n| Iron | mg | 25 | 25 | 25 |\n| Copper\\*\\* | mg | 5 | 5 | 5 |\n| Iodine | mg | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| Selenium\\*\\* | mg | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.2 |\n\n* Higher level might be possible according to local state and national regulations.\n\n\\*\\* So called \"organic sources\" should be considered with higher bioavailability.\n\n\\*\\*\\* according to fat addition \\*\\*\\*\\* double in case of heat treated feed\n\n## Supplements\n\nSupplements ensure the necessary supply of essential vitamins, trace elements and sub- stances such as anti-oxidants or carotenoids. Suitable supplementation can compensate for the varying contents of raw materials and safe- guard the supply of all necessary nutrients.\n\nRemark: Vitamin C is synthesised by poul- try normally.

Used in the second half of the rearing period, it can posi- tively influence the development of the diges- tive tract, the crop size and the appetite of pul- lets. This is beneficial for young layers, especially at the start of production, when the appetite of the birds is sometimes not sufficient enough to meet their nutrient demands. The tool has been proven to be very beneficial under vary- ing feeding situations in a lot of countries. This is the reason for the implementation of a mini- mum recommendation of crude fibre (5–6%) in the developer feed for LOHMANN layers.\n\nCereals and their by-products (e.g. bran) or oil seed by-products (e.g. meal of sunflowers or rapeseed), can be used as a source of crude fi- bre. DDGS\\*\\* can be used as a source of crude fibre as well. Other raw materials, which are rich of crude fibre, may be used if available, but only as long as their inclusion does not re- duce the energy level of the diet. With a clas- sical corn-soy diet, the recommended crude fibre content can hardly be achieved. In such cases, other feed ingredients must be used. For advice, please contact the technical service department at LOHMANN.\n\n* Non-Starch Polysaccharides \\*\\* Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles\n\n## NUTRITION\n\n## Rearing\n\nA balanced and nutritious diet during the rearing stage is essential to enable the chick to develop into a mature pullet. Chicks and pullets should be fed a coarse diet (for parti- cle sizes see table on page 17) of a meal-type consistency. A high proportion of very fine components or a structure that is too coarse can lead to selective feed intake and an un- balanced nutrient supply. A diet with an ex- tremely fine consistency reduces the feed intake of the birds and can result in a lack- ing supply of certain nutrients. If pelletising of feed is inevitable for hygienic reasons the pellets should be crumbled to the recom- mended consistency. During the different growth phases of chicks and pullets, qualita- tively different feed varieties should be used in which the nutrient content meets the birds changing needs. The diets are matched to the nutrient requirement and weight de- velopment at each stage of growth. The use of chick starter is recommended if the stand- ard body weight is not reached by feeding grower feed or if the daily feed intake is ex- pected to be low. The switch to developer should only be made when the standard body weight has been reached. A reduced nutrient density and an increased content of crude fibre (5-6 %) during this phase is ben- eficial for improving eating capacity. The pre- layer diet has about twice the calcium con- tent of developer as well as higher levels of protein and amino acids. Feeding such a diet for about 10 days prior to the planned start of lay is therefore beneficial. This diet improves flock uniformity by providing a better nutri- ent supply to late maturing birds and by ena- bling early maturing birds to obtain sufficient calcium for eggshell production of the first eggs.\n\n| Starter | Grower | Developer | Pre-lay | Layer Feed |\n| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ---------- |\n| Lysine | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |\n| Methionine | 44 | 45 | 47 | 50 |\n| Met + Cyst | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 |\n| Threonine | 66 | 70 | 70 | 70 |\n| Tryptophane | 19 | 21 | 24 | 21 |\n| Isoleucine | 69 | 76 | 76 | 80 |\n| Valine | 78 | 78 | 80 | 88 |\n| Arginine | 105 | 105 | 106 | 104 |\n\nTable 9: Ideal amino acid ratios (Digestible Lysine as 100 – others as ratios to 100) The feed should be based / calculated on the level of digestible amino acids according to an ideal amino acid profile, above table shows the ratios of the most important amino acids as ratios to Lysine on digestible level.\n\n## Correct Use of Pre-Layer Feed\n\nPre-layer feed should be used for a short pe- riod of time before a flock starts being sup- plied with phase 1 layer feed. This leads to a smooth transition from the developer feed (low calcium and low nutrient density) to a diet with high calcium and nutrient levels. It helps to avoid the often reduced appe- tite/daily feed intake during early produc- tion. Typically, pre-layer feed contains about 2.0-2.5% calcium. This is too much for a typical feed for rearing but not enough for a bird starting to produce eggs. From a nutri- tional point of view, it's therefore considered a compromise and never as \"optimal\" feed. Nevertheless, it's worthwhile to use pre-layer feed for a short period of time. Correct use can enhance the uniformity of a pullet flock. It's especially beneficial for flocks with very low uniformity and also aids the develop- ment of Ca-metabolism in medullar bones. Since pre-layer feed is a compromise feed for the short transition period, it cannot supply a bird in full lay sufficiently. Therefore, it cannot be used when feed logistics and correct tim- ing do not work.\n\nPlease consider the following recommenda- tions while using pre-layer feed:\n\n> Start using pre-layer feed dependent on\n> to the birds sexual maturity, age and their\n> standard body weights.\n> Use pre-layer feed for about 10 days with a\n> maximum of 1 kg per bird.\n> The wrong way to use pre-layer feed is ei-\n> ther to start using it too early and/or use\n> it too long.\n> For example if the onset of lay is scheduled for the 19th weeks of age, you may start feed- ing the birds with pre-layer feed only after they are 17 weeks old. In case of an earlier or later production, ad- just this schedule accordingly.\n\n| Age at transfer | | Developer Feed kg feed | Feeding programme followed by → | Pre-Layer Feed kg feed |\n| --------------- | - | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| week | days | | | |\n| 15 | 105 | 1.0 | → | 1.0 |\n| 16 | 112 | 0.5 | → | 1.0 |\n| 17 | 119 | - | → | 1.0 |\n| 18 | 126 | - | → | 0.5 |\n| after 18 | after 126 | immediately supply start lay feed or layer phase 1 feed | | |\n\n## NUTRITION\n\n## Laying Period\n\nAiming at an optimal start of production with feed intake around 90–100 g/day, it is recommendable to use a phase 1 feed with 11.6 ME MJ/kg for a duration of 5–6 weeks. At around 26 weeks a normal phase- feeding programme with 11.4 ME MJ/kg should be introduced. The basis for the feed formulation in terms of nutrient and mineral content in each phase is the daily nutrient requirement and actual feed consumption. The diet for phase 1 is designed to cover the requirement for maximum egg mass.\n\nThe recommended nutrient allowances shown in the tables 10–12 (phase 1–3) as- sume a dietary energy concentration of 11.4 MJ/kg (2725 kcal) metabolisable energy, a house temperature of 20 °C and good plumage.\n\nUnder these conditions the daily feed con- sumption of LOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC is expected to be 110–120g/day. The feed formulations for phases 2–3 cater for the re- duced requirement for organic nutrients and the increasing requirement for calcium as the hens age. The time for switching diets is determined more by the level of produc- tion and the need for calcium rather than by age.\n\n## Phase Feeding\n\n**What is the basic idea of a phase feeding program for layers?** It is and should be a smooth and continuous adaptation to the – in detail daily – varying nutrient demand of a high prolific layer hen. The nutritional demand for protein, amino acids and the main minerals are changing constantly as the performance changes gradually from the start of lay, reaching the peak performance in terms of laying per- centage and afterwards of egg mass output. Finally in aging layer flocks the egg shell quality is the biggest challenge and needs support from nutrition. All changes in diets need to follow the basic nutrient demand for egg mass production – means mainly amino acids – and the changing demand for opti- mal egg quality. As high prolific layers abso- lutely do not like big changes in the nutrient content of the feed and also in the physical feed structure – all changes must be carried out in small steps and smoothly. Even the raw material composition of the diet should only be changed in small steps. If these re- quirements are ignored – production and egg quality can easily be affected.\n\nBasic changes of the content of energy, pro- tein and amino acids should be carried out only with regard to the egg mass perfor- mance of a layer flock. This means that as long as the egg mass output of a flock does not drop – one should not decrease any of these basic nutrients in order to prevent deficiencies which will/would finally harm the flock.\n\n| Nutrient | Requirement g/Hen/Day | Daily Feed Consumption - 105 g | Daily Feed Consumption - 110 g | Daily Feed Consumption - 115 g | Daily Feed Consumption - 120 g |\n| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |\n| Protein % | 18.50 | 17.60 | 16.80 | 16.10 | 15.40 |\n| Calcium\\*\\* % | 4.10 | 3.90 | 3.73 | 3.57 | 3.42 |\n| Phosphorus\\*\\*\\* % | 0.60 | 0.57 | 0.55 | 0.52 | 0.50 |\n| Av.

Within certain limits, performance can be adapted to farm specific requirements by adjusting the lighting programme. Easiest to follow are the lighting programmes in closed houses without the effect of natural daylight. In these, the hours of light and light intensity can be adjusted to changing needs. Rearing birds in closed houses and produc- ing eggs in light-tight houses enable the producer to maximize performance. Follow the lighting programme which is recom- mended for this type of housing system and commercial variety. For open or brown-out houses (houses with incidence of daylight), a tailor made programme has to be developed which reflects the season and geographical location where the pullets are being reared and stimulated to lay. In general, the lighting programme should follow the basic principles:\n\n> Never increase hours of light during the\n> rearing period until planned stimula-\n> tion starts.\n\n## Intermittent Lighting Programme for Day Old Chicks\n\nWhen the day old chicks arrive on the farm, they have already been intensively han- dled in the hatchery and often have a long transport to their final destination. Common practice is to give them 24 hours of light to help them recover in the first 2 or 3 days after arrival and to provide them enough time to eat and drink. In practice, it can be observed that after arrival and housing, some chicks continue to sleep whereas others start to look for feed and water. The activity of the flock will always be irregular. Especially in this phase, poultry men have difficulties in- terpreting the chicks behaviour and their condition. There is a practically proven principal in split- ting the day into phases of resting and ac- tivity using a special designed intermittent lighting programme. The aim is to synchro- nize the chicks' activities. The farmer gets a better impression of the flocks condition and the birds are encouraged by the groups be- haviour to search for water and feed. Therefore, LOHMANN advises to give chicks a rest after they arrive at the rearing farm and then start with four hours of light followed by two hours of darkness.\n\n> Never decrease hours of light during\n> the production period.\n> Always keep in mind that natural day-\n> light can influence the lighting pro-\n> gramme in open or brown-out houses.\n\n## Lighting Programme after Arrival\n\nThis programme can be used for up to 7 or 10 days after arrival, then switch to the regu- lar step down lighting programme. The us- age of the following lighting program brings about the following advantages:\n\nThe chicks will rest and/or sleep at the same time. This means that the behaviour of the chicks will be synchronized.\nWeak chicks will be stimulated by stronger ones to move as well as to eat and drink.\nThe behaviour of the flock is more uniform and the judgement of the birds is made easier.\nMortality will decrease.\n\n## Lighting Programme for Closed Houses\n\nTo which extent lighting hours are reduced during the growing period and the time when stimulation begins by increasing the lighting hours are means by which perfor- mance can be adjusted to specific farm re- quirements. The following Standard Lighting Programme is designed as an example for a quick start into production.\n\nThe light intensity measured in watt/m², lumen, foot candle or lux depends on the used light source. Giving advices concerning this measurement would rather irritate than help layer farmers.\n\nTherefore the light intensity is just given in lux unit in the following table.\n\n## LIGHTING\n\nTable 13: Lighting Programme for Windowless Houses for LOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC Pullets/Layers \\* \\*Lux = Lumen/m² \\*\\* or run an intermittent Lighting Programme \\*\\*\\* until the end of production\n\n| Age (Weeks) | Hours of Light (Standard) | Light Intensity (Lux)\\* |\n| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Day 1-2 \\*\\* | 24 | 20–40 |\n| Day 3-6\\*\\* | 18 | 20–30 |\n| 2 | 16 | 10-20 |\n| 3 | 14 | 10-20 |\n| 4 | 12 | 4-6 |\n| 5 | 11 | 4-6 |\n| 6 | 10 | 4-6 |\n| 7 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 8 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 9 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 10 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 11 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 12 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 13 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 14 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 15 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 16 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 17 | 10 | 5-7 |\n| 18 | 11 | 5-7 |\n| 19 | 12 | 5-7 |\n| 20 | 13 | 10-15 |\n| 21 | 14 | 10-15 |\n| 22 | 14 | 10-15 |\n| 23 | 14 | 10-15 |\n| 24 | 14 | 10-15 |\n| 25\\*\\*\\* | 14 | 10-15 |\n\n## Lighting Programme for Open Houses\n\nThe principle for windowless houses \"Do not increase the hours of light during rearing period and do not reduce hours of light during production period\" also applies to \"open\" housing.\n\nThe effect of the natural daylight must be considered when designing lighting pro- grammes, if natural light enters the building throughout the day or if the hens have free access to open-air runs.\n\nFor example in Central Europe the natural day length increases in the course of the cal- endar year to about 17 hours until late June and then shortens to about 8 hours until late December.\n\nIf flocks are moved to an open production house with windows that cannot be dark- ened, the lighting programme must be ad- justed to the natural day length at the time of rehousing.\n\nWe distinguish between two variants:\n\n1. Production starts as the natural day length decreases.\n2. Production starts as the natural day length increases.\nIn both variations the lighting programme at 17 weeks of age should be set to a lighting period of at least 10 hours, taking the natural day length into account, and to be increased by 1 hour every week to 14 hours until 21 weeks of age.\n\nNever switch on the artificial light before 04.00 o'clock in the morning (CE time).\n\nDuring the spring months the lighting pro- gramme is affected by the increase of natural day length and gradually extends to about 17 hours. When the natural day length be- gins to decrease in Central Europe from July, the 17-hour light period should be kept constantly until the end of the production period.\n\nThis example can be accomplished in Central Europe very simply as follows:\n\n> 04\\.00\\* o'clock in the morning: lights on – dimmer switch off at ≥ 50-60 Lux.\n> Dimmer switch on at ≤ 50-60 Lux- 21.00\\* o'clock in the evening lights off.\n\n* *Central European time* These times should be varied depending on the condition of the flocks, the start of lay (production, egg size) and the facilities in the building.\n\nIf for operational reasons a different diurnal rhythm from the one described above is applied, it should not differ too much from the dawn/dusk times stated above, having regard to the diurnal rhythm of the hens.\n\n## LIGHTING\n\nAs already mentioned, the lighting pro- programme described here is just an example adjusted to Central European time. If the birds are driven indoors before the end of the natural day and if the building can be darkened completely, the lighting programme for windowless laying houses should be applied. The times for darkening the room or open- ing the windows are determined by the lighting programme. It is important to follow the correct sequence: \\> In the evening close the windows first, then switch off the light; \\> In the morning switch on the light first, then open the windows.

Do not allow the truck driver to enter the houses.\nSafeguard the houses against wild birds and vermin. Keep rats and mice under constant control.\nDispose of dead birds hygienically. Follow local laws and regulations.\n\n## Daily Control\n\nCheck at least once daily:\n\nHealth status\nTemperature\nVentilation\nFeed and water consumption\nLighting\nMortality\nWhen assessing the state of health, do not just go by the general impression and mor-tality rate, but also take note of feed and water consumption as well as the texture of droppings.\n\n## Water Supply\n\nClean water is equally as important as good feed for top performance. Therefore fresh, clean, potable water must be available at all times for the layers and an adequate con-sumption must be always assured. A water meter is a very useful tool to inspect water consumption.\n\nThe optimum water temperature is about 20 °C. Furthermore feed and water intake are closely correlated. If the birds don't drink enough water for any reason, the feed intake reduces consequently.\n\nThe water to feed ratio at comfort tempera-ture is around 1.8-2:1, but this relation in-creases up to 5:1 at high ambient tempera-tures above 30 °C. During exposure to high temperatures, birds consume less feed, but more water in an effort to cool their body down.\n\nCheck the water quality regularly, especially if you use your own water supply like well water.\n\nFor example excessive salt levels in drinking water can cause persistent damage to shell quality and hard water with high TDS\\* levels may cause kidney damage.\n\n\\*TDS: Total Dissolved Solids\n\n## GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n## Grit\n\nFeeding grit is not a must but is recommend- ed when rations are supplemented by grains. This stimulates the development of the crop and the gizzard during the rearing period, which in turn has a positive effect on feed intake capacity.\n\n| Table 14: Amount and Granulation of Grit Dependent on Age | |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- | - |\n| Week 1–2 | once a week 1 g/bird (size 1–2 mm) |\n| Week 3–8 | once a week 2 g/bird (size 3–4 mm) |\n| From week 9 | once a month 3 g/bird (size 4–6 mm) |\n\n## Litter (Non Cage Housing)\n\nOnly use shavings from untreated wood in order to avoid poisoning and residues in the egg. Provide sufficient ventilation to ensure good litter condition and remove wet litter, if nec- essary.\n\n## Egg Quality and Egg Collection\n\nLOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC layers produce eggs of excellent quality. To preserve the quality, the following points should be ob- served:\n\n> Collect eggs at least once a day.\n> Store eggs at temperatures between 5 °C\n> and 10 °C with a relative humidity of be-\n> tween 80–85 %.\n> Storing at higher temperatures and lower\n> humidity leads to rapid loss of weight and\n> impairs the quality of the egg white due to\n> an increase in gas exchange.\n\n## Nests (Non Cage Housing)\n\nThe quality of nests is also a factor which affects egg quality. Renew the litter in litter- type nests regularly and keep them clean. Provide individual nests at a rate of one nest for 4 hens. Collect floor eggs frequently to keep their rate as low as possible. In addition to sufficient nesting space in fam- ily type nests, the following factors are im- portant for a low rate of floor eggs:\n\n> Clean, dry litter or soft nest lining\n> Easy access\n> Even distribution of the nests within\n> the barn\n> Only one type of nest in the barn\n> For optimum egg quality, rollaway nests in combination with slats are better than litter- type nests or family type nests.\n\n## Stocking Density\n\nThe optimal bird density/m² depends on man-agement conditions and to which extent cli-mate can be controlled. 6-8 birds/m² can be taken as a general guide for non-cage housing. For cage systems, an area of 475–540 cm²/bird is recommended. Take note of deviating regulations for stocking density and declara-tion of eggs.\n\n## Equipment Requirements\n\nIn general, the more closely the growing house and facilities resemble the future production system, the easier it will be for the pullets to settle down in their new en-vironment after transfer to the laying house. The following tables show the equipment requirements for rearing and production period.\n\n| Table 15: Equipment Requirement for Rearing Period | Equipment | Age in Weeks | Requirement |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- |\n| | Chick founts | 1 | 1 fount (4-5 l) for 100 chicks |\n| | Round drinkers | to 20 | 1 drinker (Ø 46 cm) for 125 birds |\n| | Linear drinkers | to 20 | 1 running m for 100 birds |\n| | Nipple drinkers | to 20 | 6–8 birds per nipple |\n| | Chick feeding trays | 1–2 | 1 tray for 60 chicks |\n| | Cut off chick cartons | 1–2 | 1 carton for 100 chicks |\n| | Round feeders | 3–10 | 2 feeders (Ø 40 cm) for 100 birds |\n| | | 11–20 | 3 feeders (Ø 40 cm) for 100 birds |\n| | Chain feeders | 3–10 | 2.5–3.5 lin. m for 100 birds |\n| | | 11–20 | 4.5 lin. m for 100 birds |\n\n| Table 16: Equipment Requirement for Production Period | Equipment | Requirement |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |\n| | Round drinkers | 1 drinker (Ø 46 cm) for 125 birds |\n| | Linear drinkers | 1 running m for 80–100 birds |\n| | Nipple drinkers | 6–8 birds per nipple |\n| | Round feeders | 4 feeders (Ø 40 cm) for 100 birds |\n| | Single nests | 1 nest (26 x 30 cm) for 4 birds |\n| | Chain feeders | 5 lin. m for 100 birds |\n\nFurther details in the LOHMANN Management Guide for floor/free range housing.\n\n## GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n| Table 17: Body Weight Development of LOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC | Week 1-50 | | | |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -

    "## Why should you study this management guide?\n\nMost people who are involved in commer- cial egg production, have seen management guides for different strains of layers before and may think “if you have seen one, you’ve seen them all”. Others take the contents more se- riously and expect frequent updates to find specific data which apply to the current gen- eration of layers and current management practices. Newcomers in the business may need more detailed explanations than can be presented in this compact format. We hope that each reader will find some use- ful information, to confirm proven manage- ment practices or to stimulate improvements.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A black and white photograph of a chicken standing on the ground.)\n\n# TOP PERFORMANCE BY SYSTEMATIC SELECTION\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of a group of chicken, representing poultry management.)\nLOHMANN – the right partner for progressive, successful poultry management.\n\nIn recent decades, advanced methods have significantly improved breeding quality.

    "## General Recommendations\n\n> Before bringing in the chicks, check that\n> everything is in good working order.\n> Warm up the house in good time up to\n> 35-36 °C. In summer start heating at least\n> 24 hours and in winter at least 48 hours\n> before the chicks arrive. When the right\n> temperature has been achieved, supply\n> minimum ventilation. This will avoid tem-\n> perature differences within the house.\n> Maintain the recommended temperatures\n> (35-36 °C) during the first 48-72 hours.\n> Relative humidity should be at least 60%.\n> The right height of the drinkers must be\n> adjusted to allow the chicks to drink water\n> without difficulty.\n> Reduce the water pressure of the nipples\n> in order to enable the chicks to find water\n> easily.\n> Keep drinking water temperature be-\n> tween 20-25 °C by temporarily flushing\n> the nipple drinker lines or renewing the\n> water in the chick founts.\n> Follow the recommended lighting pro-\n> grammes (refer to page 26).\n\n## Cage Systems\n\n> Adjust the cage floors and feeding grids\n> according to the manufacturer's instruc-\n> tions.\n> Place sheets of paper on the cage floor\n> for the first days and distribute a bit of\n> feed on this paper. The papers must be\n> removed by day 7.\n> Unload all chick boxes and distribute them\n> in the house. Remove all lids and place\n> them on the top of the boxes.\n> Quickly place the chicks near feeders\n> and drinkers. Distribute the chicks evenly\n> among the cages starting at the far end of\n> the house.\n> Trigger nipples/water cups to encourage\n> birds to drink.\n",
    "## Floor Systems\n\n> Before arrival of the chicks, litter should\n> be spread only after heating the house,\n> when the floor has reached the optimum\n> temperature. Softwood shavings or straw\n> make suitable litter.\n> After arrival, place chicks under brooders\n> as soon as possible.\n> Measure the brooder temperature by plac-\n> ing the thermometer 8 cm inside the outer\n> edge of the brooder and 8 cm above the\n> litter.\n> Dip the beaks of a few chicks into water\n> and trigger nipple or water cups to help\n> them start drinking. When drinking water\n> has been found by all chicks (this will take\n> approx. 2-3 hours), they will start to eat.\n> Supply the chicks with additional feeding\n> bowls to ensure a better feed intake in the\n> first few days.\n> Chicks should be fully feathered before\n> brooding equipment has to be removed.\n\n# Body Temperature of the Chicks\n\nThe body temperature of housed chicks is a very useful indicator to adjust house tem- perature in an optimum way. A simple tool to measure the body temperature of day old chicks is usage of modern ear thermometers, known from human medicine. The correct application to measure the body tempera- ture is just to touch the cloaca gently with the thermometer probe. The optimal body temperature of the chicks is about 40 to 41 °C.\n\nObtain samples of the chicks distributed in different parts of the house in order to have reliable results. Proceed in a way you nor- mally do while weighing chicks/pullets to check their uniformity. Collect the informa- tion, calculate the average and adjust house temperature accordingly to achieve optimal chick temperatures. For example increase the house temperature by 0.5 °C, if the av- erage body temperature of the chicks is 39.5 °C.\n\nBesides house temperature, there are other factors which could affect the body temper- ature of the chicks negatively:\n\n> Insufficient air distribution in the house\n> Low humidity level (heat transfer capacity of the air)\n> Missing to pre-warm the house at the right time\n> After a few hours, check whether the chicks have settled down well. The chicks behav- iour is the best indicator of their well-being:\n",
    "> If the chicks are evenly spread out and moving freely, temperature and ventila- tion are all right.\n> If the chicks are crowding together or avoiding certain areas within the house, temperature is too low or there is a draught.\n> If the chicks are lying about on the floor with outspread wings and gasping for air, temperature is too high.\n> !\\[Image description\\](A photo of a person using an ear thermometer on a small chick.)\n> At first signs that the chicks are not feeling well determine the reason, correct the situa- tion and check more frequently.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\nEnvironmental conditions have an effect on the well-being and performance of the birds. Important environmental factors are tem-perature, humidity and level of toxic gases in the air. The optimal temperature depends on the age of the birds. The following table is a guide to the correct temperature at bird lev- el. As mentioned before, the birds behaviour is the best indicator for correct temperature. Always reduce temperature gradually, and avoid sudden changes. If the ventilation system is used to regulate temperature, take care that the necessary fresh air is supplied.\n\n| Age | Temperature °C |\n| --- | -------------- |\n| Day 1-2\\* | 35–36 |\n| Day 3–4 | 33–34 |\n| Day 5–7 | 31–32 |\n| Week 2 | 28–29 |\n| Week 3 | 26–27 |\n| Week 4 | 22–24 |\n| From Week 5 | 18–20 |\n\n* Body temperatures of 40–41 °C are the optimum for the chicks.\n\nThe relative humidity inside the house should be about 60–70 %.\n\nThe air quality should meet the following minimum requirements:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| - | - | - |\n| O₂ | over | 20% |\n| CO 2 | under | 0.3% |\n| CO | under | 40 ppm |\n| NH 3 | under | 20 ppm |\n| H₂S | under | 5 ppm |\n\n## VACCINATION\n",
    "## General Recommendations\n\nVaccination is an important way of prevent- ing diseases. Different regional epidemic sit- uations require suitably adapted vaccination programmes. Therefore, please be guided, by the advice of your local veterinarian and poultry health service. Only healthy flocks should be vaccinated. Check the expiration date of the vaccine. The vaccine must not be used after this date. Keep records of all vac- cinations and vaccine serial numbers.\n\n## Vaccination Methods\n\nIndividual Vaccinations such as injections and eye-drops are very effective and gener- ally well tolerated but also very labour inten- sive.\n\nDrinking Water Vaccinations are not la- bour intensive but must be carried out with the greatest care to be effective. The water used for preparing the vaccine solution must not contain any disinfectants. During the growing period, the birds should be with- out water for approximately 2 hours prior to vaccination. During hot weather reduce this time accordingly. The amount of vaccine solution should be calculated for complete consumption within 2–4 hours. When vac- cinating with live vaccines, add 2g of skim milk powder per litre of water or canned milk in order to protect the virus titre, if no water stabilisator is available.\n\nSpray Vaccinations are not labour intensive and are highly effective, but may occasion ally have side effects. For chicks up to the age of 3 weeks apply only coarse spray. Use dis- tilled water for vaccination.\n",
    "## Special Recommendations\n\nMarek Re-Vaccinations have proved to be successful after long transportation and in areas with high infection risk. Consult your veterinarian and the LOHMANN Technical Service Team for further information.\n\nMycoplasmosis Vaccinations are only advisable if the farm cannot be kept free of mycoplasmosis. Infections with virulent mycoplasma species during the produc- tion period lead to performance depression. The best performance is achieved by flocks which are kept free of mycoplasmosis and are not vaccinated.\n\nVaccination against Coccidiosis is the most reliable method in the floor rearing to develop immunity against this disease. Never use coccidiostats in the feed when pullets are vaccinated.\n\nApplying Vitamins in the first two to three days after vaccination can help to reduce stress and prevent undesired reactions. To what extent depends on the specific situa- tion on each farm.\n\n# VACCINATION\n",

The right choice of vaccine is crucial. Never vaccinate very young birds with high-virulence live vaccine. Depending on infectious pressure, birds are vaccinated with inactivated vaccine during the rearing and/or prior onset of lay for booster the immunity. Revaccination with live ND and/or IB every 6–8 weeks during production period is beneficial in order to improve the local immunity.\n",
    "A severe vaccination programme especially intramuscular injections may depress the body weight development.\n\n# BEAK TREATMENT\n\nBeak treatment is not necessary under opti- mal conditions. In practice, it is widely used in environmental controlled and light-tight facilities, as an efficient precaution against cannibalism and feather pecking. Such be- haviour may develop at any age as a result of excessive light intensity, unbalanced feed, poor ventilation, overstocking or boredom. Especially in floor management and/or open houses with uncontrollable light intensity, we recommend beak treatment subject to local animal welfare regulations. A very gentle and highly recommended method of beak treat- ment is the infrared treatment of the upper and lower beak by means of a special tech- nique, performed shortly after chicks hatch. This procedure can already be done in the hatchery under very hygienic conditions by specially trained personnel. Another method of beak treatment is to treat the beaks with a hot blade.\n\nUse only equipment and blades in perfect working order; adjust the blade tempera- ture so that cauterisation is guaranteed and the beak is not damaged.\nAdjust temperature and duration of the treatment according to the chicks beak size, strength and quality.\n\n## Observe the following pre- cautions for a conventional beak treatment:\n\nDo not feed for 12 hours before treating.\nTreat only healthy, unstressed birds, at the age of 7-10 days.\nOffer free feeding immediately after treating.\nAllow only experienced personnel to do the work.\nIncrease the level of feed in the troughs.\nWork slowly and carefully.\nIncrease the temperature in the house for a few days after treating.\nFor 3–5 days after beak treating provide an extra hour of light and supply feed in the late evening or at night.\nGiving vitamins via the drinking water can also help to alleviate stress.\n\n## NUTRITION\n",
    "## General\n\nTo get the best out of the genetic perfor- mance potential of LOHMANN BROWN- CLASSIC layers, feeding them with a good structured mash feed with full nutritive value is a must. Such nutrition can best be guar- anteed by a complete feed adapted to the performance potential. Our feeding recommendations concentrate on the essential nutrients and are designed to cover the requirements for the best per- formance in every stage of development.\n\n## Ad Libitum Feed Supply\n\nLOHMANN Layers and their breeders are specialised birds selected for a high egg pro- duction. Because of their high turnover rates “feed into food”, they have a big demand for nutrients. Layers in full production convert roughly one third of the consumed nutrients into eggs. There is no danger in wasting feed by sup- plying feed ad libitum, because the hens can adjust their intake to the nutrient density of the feed.

    "## Nutrition and Egg Weight\n\nWithin certain limits egg weight can be adapted to farm specific requirements by adjusting rations. The following nutritional factors should be noted:\n\n> Growing\n> Feeding for higher body weight/frame size increases the egg weight through- out the whole laying period.\n> Feed composition\n> crude protein and methionine\n> linoleic acid\n> Feeding technique\n> feed texture\n> feeding time\n> feed level in troughs\n> controlled feeding\n> frequency of feeding\n> By stimulating feed intake egg weight can be increased and limited by controlled feed- ing. In the case of appropriate house con- struction, there's the possibility to adjust the house temperature in the opposite direction of desired egg weight and feed intake.\n\nContact your LOHMANN specialists for spe- cific programmes with recommendations for nutrition and management adjusted to your conditions and requirements.\n\n| Table 6: Recommended Particle-Size Distribution for Chick Starter, Grower, Developer and Layer Feed (MASH) | Sieve Size | Passing Part | Sieve Size Interval | Part of Interval |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- |\n|  | 0.5 mm | 19% | 0-0.5 mm | 19% |\n|  | 1.0 mm | 40% | 0.51-1.0 mm | 21% |\n|  | 1.5 mm | 75% | 1.01-1.5 mm | 35% |\n|  | 2.0 mm | 90% | 1.51-2.0 mm | 15% |\n|  | 2.5 mm | 100% | \\> 2 mm | 10%\\* |\n|  |  |  |  | 100% |\n\n* Individual Particles not bigger than: \\> 3 mm in chick superstarter-/starter diets \\> 5 mm in grower, developer and layer The above table should be understood as an example for a homogenous mash feed structure.\n\nDifferent technique in feed production may lead to different particle sizes and variation.\n\nThe overall target for mash feed structure needs to be optimal homogeneity.\n\nMash feed with \"some finer\" or \"some coarser\" structure will be optimal as well, as long the structure ensures optimal homogeneity.\n\nVariation in feed structure from batch to batch and within different feed delive- ries should be as low as possible.\n",

    "## Crude Fibre\n\nCrude fibre, sometimes described as insoluble NSP\\*, may not have nutritional values for poul- try, but it does have other benefits for a healthy and stable digestive physiology. Used in the second half of the rearing period, it can posi- tively influence the development of the diges- tive tract, the crop size and the appetite of pul- lets. This is beneficial for young layers, especially at the start of production, when the appetite of the birds is sometimes not sufficient enough to meet their nutrient demands. The tool has been proven to be very beneficial under vary- ing feeding situations in a lot of countries. This is the reason for the implementation of a mini- mum recommendation of crude fibre (5–6%) in the developer feed for LOHMANN layers.\n\nCereals and their by-products (e.g. bran) or oil seed by-products (e.g. meal of sunflowers or rapeseed), can be used as a source of crude fi- bre. DDGS\\*\\* can be used as a source of crude fibre as well. Other raw materials, which are rich of crude fibre, may be used if available, but only as long as their inclusion does not re- duce the energy level of the diet. With a clas- sical corn-soy diet, the recommended crude fibre content can hardly be achieved. In such cases, other feed ingredients must be used. For advice, please contact the technical service department at LOHMANN.\n\n* Non-Starch Polysaccharides \\*\\* Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles\n\n# NUTRITION\n",
    "## Rearing\n\nA balanced and nutritious diet during the rearing stage is essential to enable the chick to develop into a mature pullet. Chicks and pullets should be fed a coarse diet (for parti- cle sizes see table on page 17) of a meal-type consistency. A high proportion of very fine components or a structure that is too coarse can lead to selective feed intake and an un- balanced nutrient supply. A diet with an ex- tremely fine consistency reduces the feed intake of the birds and can result in a lack- ing supply of certain nutrients. If pelletising of feed is inevitable for hygienic reasons the pellets should be crumbled to the recom- mended consistency. During the different growth phases of chicks and pullets, qualita- tively different feed varieties should be used in which the nutrient content meets the birds changing needs. The diets are matched to the nutrient requirement and weight de- velopment at each stage of growth. The use of chick starter is recommended if the stand- ard body weight is not reached by feeding grower feed or if the daily feed intake is ex- pected to be low. The switch to developer should only be made when the standard body weight has been reached. A reduced nutrient density and an increased content of crude fibre (5-6 %) during this phase is ben- eficial for improving eating capacity. The pre- layer diet has about twice the calcium con- tent of developer as well as higher levels of protein and amino acids. Feeding such a diet for about 10 days prior to the planned start of lay is therefore beneficial. This diet improves flock uniformity by providing a better nutri- ent supply to late maturing birds and by ena- bling early maturing birds to obtain sufficient calcium for eggshell production of the first eggs.\n",

    "## Correct Use of Pre-Layer Feed\n\nPre-layer feed should be used for a short pe- riod of time before a flock starts being sup- plied with phase 1 layer feed. This leads to a smooth transition from the developer feed (low calcium and low nutrient density) to a diet with high calcium and nutrient levels. It helps to avoid the often reduced appe- tite/daily feed intake during early produc- tion. Typically, pre-layer feed contains about 2.0-2.5% calcium. This is too much for a typical feed for rearing but not enough for a bird starting to produce eggs. From a nutri- tional point of view, it's therefore considered a compromise and never as \"optimal\" feed. Nevertheless, it's worthwhile to use pre-layer feed for a short period of time. Correct use can enhance the uniformity of a pullet flock. It's especially beneficial for flocks with very low uniformity and also aids the develop- ment of Ca-metabolism in medullar bones. Since pre-layer feed is a compromise feed for the short transition period, it cannot supply a bird in full lay sufficiently. Therefore, it cannot be used when feed logistics and correct tim- ing do not work.\n\nPlease consider the following recommenda- tions while using pre-layer feed:\n\n> Start using pre-layer feed dependent on\n> to the birds sexual maturity, age and their\n> standard body weights.\n> Use pre-layer feed for about 10 days with a\n> maximum of 1 kg per bird.\n> The wrong way to use pre-layer feed is ei-\n> ther to start using it too early and/or use\n> it too long.\n> For example if the onset of lay is scheduled for the 19th weeks of age, you may start feed- ing the birds with pre-layer feed only after they are 17 weeks old. In case of an earlier or later production, ad- just this schedule accordingly.\n",

At around 26 weeks a normal phase- feeding programme with 11.4 ME MJ/kg should be introduced. The basis for the feed formulation in terms of nutrient and mineral content in each phase is the daily nutrient requirement and actual feed consumption. The diet for phase 1 is designed to cover the requirement for maximum egg mass.\n\nThe recommended nutrient allowances shown in the tables 10–12 (phase 1–3) as- sume a dietary energy concentration of 11.4 MJ/kg (2725 kcal) metabolisable energy, a house temperature of 20 °C and good plumage.\n\nUnder these conditions the daily feed con- sumption of LOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC is expected to be 110–120g/day. The feed formulations for phases 2–3 cater for the re- duced requirement for organic nutrients and the increasing requirement for calcium as the hens age. The time for switching diets is determined more by the level of produc- tion and the need for calcium rather than by age.\n",
    "## Phase Feeding\n\n**What is the basic idea of a phase feeding program for layers?** It is and should be a smooth and continuous adaptation to the – in detail daily – varying nutrient demand of a high prolific layer hen. The nutritional demand for protein, amino acids and the main minerals are changing constantly as the performance changes gradually from the start of lay, reaching the peak performance in terms of laying per- centage and afterwards of egg mass output. Finally in aging layer flocks the egg shell quality is the biggest challenge and needs support from nutrition. All changes in diets need to follow the basic nutrient demand for egg mass production – means mainly amino acids – and the changing demand for opti- mal egg quality. As high prolific layers abso- lutely do not like big changes in the nutrient content of the feed and also in the physical feed structure – all changes must be carried out in small steps and smoothly. Even the raw material composition of the diet should only be changed in small steps. If these re- quirements are ignored – production and egg quality can easily be affected.\n\nBasic changes of the content of energy, pro- tein and amino acids should be carried out only with regard to the egg mass perfor- mance of a layer flock. This means that as long as the egg mass output of a flock does not drop – one should not decrease any of these basic nutrients in order to prevent deficiencies which will/would finally harm the flock.\n",

    "LIGHTING\n\n## General\n\nThe lighting programme controls the onset of lay and affects the performance. Within certain limits, performance can be adapted to farm specific requirements by adjusting the lighting programme. Easiest to follow are the lighting programmes in closed houses without the effect of natural daylight. In these, the hours of light and light intensity can be adjusted to changing needs. Rearing birds in closed houses and produc- ing eggs in light-tight houses enable the producer to maximize performance. Follow the lighting programme which is recom- mended for this type of housing system and commercial variety. For open or brown-out houses (houses with incidence of daylight), a tailor made programme has to be developed which reflects the season and geographical location where the pullets are being reared and stimulated to lay. In general, the lighting programme should follow the basic principles:\n\n> Never increase hours of light during the\n> rearing period until planned stimula-\n> tion starts.\n",
    "## Intermittent Lighting Programme for Day Old Chicks\n\nWhen the day old chicks arrive on the farm, they have already been intensively han- dled in the hatchery and often have a long transport to their final destination. Common practice is to give them 24 hours of light to help them recover in the first 2 or 3 days after arrival and to provide them enough time to eat and drink. In practice, it can be observed that after arrival and housing, some chicks continue to sleep whereas others start to look for feed and water. The activity of the flock will always be irregular. Especially in this phase, poultry men have difficulties in- terpreting the chicks behaviour and their condition. There is a practically proven principal in split- ting the day into phases of resting and ac- tivity using a special designed intermittent lighting programme. The aim is to synchro- nize the chicks' activities. The farmer gets a better impression of the flocks condition and the birds are encouraged by the groups be- haviour to search for water and feed. Therefore, LOHMANN advises to give chicks a rest after they arrive at the rearing farm and then start with four hours of light followed by two hours of darkness.\n\n> Never decrease hours of light during\n> the production period.\n> Always keep in mind that natural day-\n> light can influence the lighting pro-\n> gramme in open or brown-out houses.\n\n## Lighting Programme after Arrival\n\nThis programme can be used for up to 7 or 10 days after arrival, then switch to the regu- lar step down lighting programme. The us- age of the following lighting program brings about the following advantages:\n\nThe chicks will rest and/or sleep at the same time. This means that the behaviour of the chicks will be synchronized.\nWeak chicks will be stimulated by stronger ones to move as well as to eat and drink.\nThe behaviour of the flock is more uniform and the judgement of the birds is made easier.\nMortality will decrease.\n",
    "## Lighting Programme for Closed Houses\n\nTo which extent lighting hours are reduced during the growing period and the time when stimulation begins by increasing the lighting hours are means by which perfor- mance can be adjusted to specific farm re- quirements. The following Standard Lighting Programme is designed as an example for a quick start into production.\n\nThe light intensity measured in watt/m², lumen, foot candle or lux depends on the used light source. Giving advices concerning this measurement would rather irritate than help layer farmers.\n\nTherefore the light intensity is just given in lux unit in the following table.\n",
    "## LIGHTING\n\nTable 13: Lighting Programme for Windowless Houses for LOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC Pullets/Layers \\* \\*Lux = Lumen/m² \\*\\* or run an intermittent Lighting Programme \\*\\*\\* until the end of production\n\n| Age (Weeks) | Hours of Light (Standard) | Light Intensity (Lux)\\* |\n| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Day 1-2 \\*\\* | 24 | 20–40 |\n| Day 3-6\\*\\* | 18 | 20–30 |\n| 2 | 16 | 10-20 |\n| 3 | 14 | 10-20 |\n| 4 | 12 | 4-6 |\n| 5 | 11 | 4-6 |\n| 6 | 10 | 4-6 |\n| 7 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 8 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 9 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 10 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 11 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 12 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 13 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 14 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 15 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 16 | 9 | 4-6 |\n| 17 | 10 | 5-7 |\n| 18 | 11 | 5-7 |\n| 19 | 12 | 5-7 |\n| 20 | 13 | 10-15 |\n| 21 | 14 | 10-15 |\n| 22 | 14 | 10-15 |\n| 23 | 14 | 10-15 |\n| 24 | 14 | 10-15 |\n| 25\\*\\*\\* | 14 | 10-15 |\n\n# Lighting Programme for Open Houses\n\nThe principle for windowless houses \"Do not increase the hours of light during rearing period and do not reduce hours of light during production period\" also applies to \"open\" housing.\n\nThe effect of the natural daylight must be considered when designing lighting pro- grammes, if natural light enters the building throughout the day or if the hens have free access to open-air runs.\n\nFor example in Central Europe the natural day length increases in the course of the cal- endar year to about 17 hours until late June and then shortens to about 8 hours until late December.\n\nIf flocks are moved to an open production house with windows that cannot be dark- ened, the lighting programme must be ad- justed to the natural day length at the time of rehousing.\n",
    "We distinguish between two variants:\n\n1. Production starts as the natural day length decreases.\n2. Production starts as the natural day length increases.\n   In both variations the lighting programme at 17 weeks of age should be set to a lighting period of at least 10 hours, taking the natural day length into account, and to be increased by 1 hour every week to 14 hours until 21 weeks of age.\n\nNever switch on the artificial light before 04.00 o'clock in the morning (CE time).\n\nDuring the spring months the lighting pro- gramme is affected by the increase of natural day length and gradually extends to about 17 hours. When the natural day length be- gins to decrease in Central Europe from July, the 17-hour light period should be kept constantly until the end of the production period.\n\nThis example can be accomplished in Central Europe very simply as follows:\n\n> 04\\.00\\* o'clock in the morning: lights on – dimmer switch off at ≥ 50-60 Lux.\n> Dimmer switch on at ≤ 50-60 Lux- 21.00\\* o'clock in the evening lights off.\n\n* *Central European time* These times should be varied depending on the condition of the flocks, the start of lay (production, egg size) and the facilities in the building.\n\nIf for operational reasons a different diurnal rhythm from the one described above is applied, it should not differ too much from the dawn/dusk times stated above, having regard to the diurnal rhythm of the hens.\n\n# LIGHTING\n\nAs already mentioned, the lighting pro- programme described here is just an example adjusted to Central European time. If the birds are driven indoors before the end of the natural day and if the building can be darkened completely, the lighting programme for windowless laying houses should be applied. The times for darkening the room or open- ing the windows are determined by the lighting programme. It is important to follow the correct sequence: \\> In the evening close the windows first, then switch off the light; \\> In the morning switch on the light first, then open the windows.

Do not allow the truck driver to enter the houses.\nSafeguard the houses against wild birds and vermin. Keep rats and mice under constant control.\nDispose of dead birds hygienically. Follow local laws and regulations.\n",
    "## Daily Control\n\nCheck at least once daily:\n\nHealth status\nTemperature\nVentilation\nFeed and water consumption\nLighting\nMortality\nWhen assessing the state of health, do not just go by the general impression and mor-tality rate, but also take note of feed and water consumption as well as the texture of droppings.\n\n## Water Supply\n\nClean water is equally as important as good feed for top performance. Therefore fresh, clean, potable water must be available at all times for the layers and an adequate con-sumption must be always assured. A water meter is a very useful tool to inspect water consumption.\n\nThe optimum water temperature is about 20 °C. Furthermore feed and water intake are closely correlated. If the birds don't drink enough water for any reason, the feed intake reduces consequently.\n\nThe water to feed ratio at comfort tempera-ture is around 1.8-2:1, but this relation in-creases up to 5:1 at high ambient tempera-tures above 30 °C. During exposure to high temperatures, birds consume less feed, but more water in an effort to cool their body down.\n\nCheck the water quality regularly, especially if you use your own water supply like well water.\n\nFor example excessive salt levels in drinking water can cause persistent damage to shell quality and hard water with high TDS\\* levels may cause kidney damage.\n\n\\*TDS: Total Dissolved Solids\n\n## GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n## Grit\n\nFeeding grit is not a must but is recommend- ed when rations are supplemented by grains. This stimulates the development of the crop and the gizzard during the rearing period, which in turn has a positive effect on feed intake capacity.\n\n| Table 14: Amount and Granulation of Grit Dependent on Age |  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- | - |\n| Week 1–2 | once a week 1 g/bird (size 1–2 mm) |\n| Week 3–8 | once a week 2 g/bird (size 3–4 mm) |\n| From week 9 | once a month 3 g/bird (size 4–6 mm) |\n",
    "## Litter (Non Cage Housing)\n\nOnly use shavings from untreated wood in order to avoid poisoning and residues in the egg. Provide sufficient ventilation to ensure good litter condition and remove wet litter, if nec- essary.\n\n## Egg Quality and Egg Collection\n\nLOHMANN BROWN-CLASSIC layers produce eggs of excellent quality. To preserve the quality, the following points should be ob- served:\n\n> Collect eggs at least once a day.\n> Store eggs at temperatures between 5 °C\n> and 10 °C with a relative humidity of be-\n> tween 80–85 %.\n> Storing at higher temperatures and lower\n> humidity leads to rapid loss of weight and\n> impairs the quality of the egg white due to\n> an increase in gas exchange.\n\n## Nests (Non Cage Housing)\n\nThe quality of nests is also a factor which affects egg quality. Renew the litter in litter- type nests regularly and keep them clean. Provide individual nests at a rate of one nest for 4 hens. Collect floor eggs frequently to keep their rate as low as possible. In addition to sufficient nesting space in fam- ily type nests, the following factors are im- portant for a low rate of floor eggs:\n\n> Clean, dry litter or soft nest lining\n> Easy access\n> Even distribution of the nests within\n> the barn\n> Only one type of nest in the barn\n> For optimum egg quality, rollaway nests in combination with slats are better than litter- type nests or family type nests.\n\n## Stocking Density\n\nThe optimal bird density/m² depends on man-agement conditions and to which extent cli-mate can be controlled. 6-8 birds/m² can be taken as a general guide for non-cage housing. For cage systems, an area of 475–540 cm²/bird is recommended. Take note of deviating regulations for stocking density and declara-tion of eggs.\n",
    "## Equipment Requirements\n\nIn general, the more closely the growing house and facilities resemble the future production system, the easier it will be for the pullets to settle down in their new en-vironment after transfer to the laying house. The following tables show the equipment requirements for rearing and production period.\n\n| Table 15: Equipment Requirement for Rearing Period | Equipment | Age in Weeks | Requirement |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- |\n|  | Chick founts | 1 | 1 fount (4-5 l) for 100 chicks |\n|  | Round drinkers | to 20 | 1 drinker (Ø 46 cm) for 125 birds |\n|  | Linear drinkers | to 20 | 1 running m for 100 birds |\n|  | Nipple drinkers | to 20 | 6–8 birds per nipple |\n|  | Chick feeding trays | 1–2 | 1 tray for 60 chicks |\n|  | Cut off chick cartons | 1–2 | 1 carton for 100 chicks |\n|  | Round feeders | 3–10 | 2 feeders (Ø 40 cm) for 100 birds |\n|  |  | 11–20 | 3 feeders (Ø 40 cm) for 100 birds |\n|  | Chain feeders | 3–10 | 2.5–3.5 lin. m for 100 birds |\n|  |  | 11–20 | 4.5 lin. m for 100 birds |\n\n| Table 16: Equipment Requirement for Production Period | Equipment | Requirement |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |\n|  | Round drinkers | 1 drinker (Ø 46 cm) for 125 birds |\n|  | Linear drinkers | 1 running m for 80–100 birds |\n|  | Nipple drinkers | 6–8 birds per nipple |\n|  | Round feeders | 4 feeders (Ø 40 cm) for 100 birds |\n|  | Single nests | 1 nest (26 x 30 cm) for 4 birds |\n|  | Chain feeders | 5 lin. m for 100 birds |\n\nFurther details in the LOHMANN Management Guide for floor/free range housing.\n\n## GENERAL INFORMATION\n",
