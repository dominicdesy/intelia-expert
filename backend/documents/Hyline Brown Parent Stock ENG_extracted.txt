## House Preparation

PS flocks should be placed in environmentally controlled and light tight housing.
All-in, all-out (single age) management provides the best control for sanitation programs and disease
prevention.
Brooder house should be completely cleaned and disinfected. Confirm effectiveness of cleaning and
disinfection with environmental swabs.
Allow a minimum of 4 weeks downtime between flocks.
Pre-heat the house to recommended brooding temperature at least 24 hours prior to chick arrival. Complete
all preparations to the brooding area for an ideal environment for the PS chicks.
All feed and manure should be removed from the house before cleaning.
Thoroughly clean air inlets, fan housing, fan blades and fan louvers.
Heating the house during washing improves the removal of organic matter.
Use foam / gel disinfection/detergent to soak into organic matter and equipment.
Wash the upper portion of the house and work downward toward the manure pit.
Use high pressure warm water to rinse.
Allow the house to dry.
After it is fully dry, apply foam / spray disinfectant followed by fumigation.
Flush and sanitize water lines.
Verify effective cleaning and disinfection of the house with environmental swabs tested for *salmonella*.
Allow the house to dry before repopulating.
For more information, see [Pre-Housing Cleaning, Disinfection and Maintenance Checklist for Rearing and
Layer Houses](_____).

## Brooding Recommendations

Brood chicks in groups from similar aged breeder flocks.
Brood male and female chicks separately from 0-4 weeks.
Modify temperature as needed to meet chicks' comfort needs.
Adjust brooding temperature according to relative humidity. Lower temperatures can be used with higher relative humidity.
Find optimum balance of temperature, humidity and ventilation rate for chick comfort.
For every 5 percentage point increase above 60% relative humidity, reduce brooding temperatures by 1°C.
Pre-heat brooding houses prior to chick placement: 24 hours in normal climates, 48 hours in cool climates and 72 hours in cold climates.
Establish proper house temperature of 33-36°C (air temperature measured at chick level) and 60% humidity 24 hours before chick placement; floor temperature should be 32°C.
Bright light (30-50 lux) during 0-7 days helps chicks quickly find feed and water and adapt to new environment.
After first week, reduce temperature weekly 2-3°C until reaching 21°C.
Chicks' body weight should double between arrival on farm and 7 days of age.
| AGE | 0–3 days | 4–7 days | 8–14 days | 15–21 days | 22–28 days | 29–35 days | 36–42 days |
| --- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| AIR TEMP. (CAGE) | 33–36° C | | | | | | |
| AIR TEMP. (FLOOR) | 35–36° C | 30–32° C | 28–30°C | | | | |
| LIGHT INTENSITY | 30–50 lux | 33–35° C | | | | | |
| LIGHT HOURS | Intermittent Program or 22 hours | 30–50 lux Intermittent Program or 21 hours | 31–33° C | 26–28° C | | | |
| | | | 25 lux | 29–31° C | 23–26° C | | |
| | | | 25 lux | 26–27° C | | 21-23° C | |
| | | 20 hours | | | 25 lux | | 21° C |
| | | | 19 hours | | | 23-25° C | |
| | | | | 18 hours | | | 21° C |

## CROP FILL – ARE THE CHICKS EATING?

| Hours after chick placement | Chicks with feed in crop | | |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | - | - |
| 6 | 75% | | |
| 12 | 85% | Chick with starter feed in crop | Chick without starter feed in crop |
| 24 | 100% | | |

Brooding temperatures that are too low or too high will decrease the percentage of chicks with crop fill.

## RELATIVE HUMIDITY

## Low humidity

Reduces bird comfort
Increases dehydration
May result in pasty vents in chicks
May increase agitation and possibility of pecking
Adversely affects feather cover
Increases dust

## Excessive humidity

Increases ammonia
Causes poor litter and air quality
| Hatching 80% | Transportation to Farm 70% |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| | |

| Brooding (0-7 days) 60% | Rearing 40% minimum | Laying 40% minimum |

Cloacal temperature of the chicks should be 40°C.

## BROODER RING DESIGN

## Supplemental chick drinkers

Drinking water should be tested for quality and cleanliness from source and end of the water line.
Flush water lines prior to chick arrival.
Flush water lines weekly during rearing and production periods.
Clean supplemental chick drinkers frequently to avoid build-up of organic matter that could encourage bacterial growth.
Use a ratio of 80 chicks / drinker (25 cm diameter).
Chicks should not have to move more than 1 meter to find water.
Use vitamins and electrolytes in chicks' water (avoid sugar-based products to prevent growth of microorganisms).

## Paper/Litter

Cover entire floor of brooder ring with paper.
Put starter feed on paper for 0–3 days. For beak- treated chicks, feed on paper for 0–7 days.
Remove paper at 7–14 days to avoid the buildup of manure.
Litter should not be more than 5 cm deep.
Spread litter after concrete floors have warmed.

## Tray feeders

Use a ratio of 80 chicks / feeder.
Use good quality crumble starter feed consisting of uniform 1–2 mm particles.

## Supplemental tray feeders

Use a ratio of 80 chicks / feeder.
Use good quality crumble starter feed consisting of uniform 1–2 mm particles.
Have feed in the permanent feeding system from the first day.

## Management

Place PS chicks into the appropriate brooding pen one at a time after confirming correct line identity.
Males and females should be brooded together.
Enlarge brooder rings at 3 days to increase group size.
Continue enlarging brooder rings until rings are removed by 14 days.
Gradually remove supplemental drinkers and tray feeders beginning at 3 days.

## Cage Brooding

Parents can be reared in cages, if the birds are moved to colony breeding cages or into cages for artificial insemination.
Place feed on cage paper 0-3 days to encourage consumption. For beak-treated chicks, feed on paper for 0-7 days.
Start chicks in upper tiered cages, which are usually warmer and brighter.
Place feed on the paper in front of permanent feeder to train chicks to move toward feeders.
From 0–4 weeks, rear males separately to improve male body weight gain.

## Beak Treatment / Trimming (Check local regulations)

Hy-Line Brown Parent Stock is most successfully beak trimmed at hatch by infrared beak treatment or between 7-10 days of age by precision beak trimming.
Depending on variety and beak, re-trim at 6 weeks or 12-14 weeks of age.
Roosters should be infrared treated or receive a light beak trim (tipping) at 7-10 days.
Beak treatment or beak trimming reduces feed wastage and leaves beak less damaging to other birds.

## Infrared Beak Treatment (IRBT)

Infrared beak treatment has been proven a successful, non-invasive method of controlling the growth of the beak in egg type chickens.
One (properly applied) IRBT should be sufficient.
Hatchery beak treatment reduces feed wastage and leaves the beak less damaging to other birds.
Hatchery beak treatment is more efficient and uniform than on-farm practices.
Over the next 14-21 days, the treated beak tip will soften and wear off gradually.
Infrared treatment is adjustable to manage differences in breeder flock age, chick size, climate, housing system, and variety of birds.
For more information, see \[Infrared Beak Treatment\](Infrared Beak Treatment).
!\[Image description\](Loading chick)
!\[Image description\](Infrared beak treatment can be modified according to local conditions.)
!\[Image description\](One day post-treatment)

## Precautions when performing IRBT:

Water intake is the most important factor for success with IRBT chicks. Chicks require immediate and easy access to water.
If using nipple drinkers, use only 360° activated nipples for IRBT chicks, as well as supplemental chick drinkers.
Nipple drinkers with splash cups provide additional support for IRBT chicks.
Keep feed at the highest level in the feeder for several days after beak treatment.
Feed on paper for 0-7 days.
Provide extra light (30-50 lux) on nipple drinkers after beak treatment.

## Precision Beak Trimming

Cauterize beak for 2 seconds at 650°C.

> > When cauterizing blade is not hot enough or cauterization time is \< 2 seconds, beak will continue to grow unevenly.
> > If cauterizing blade is too hot or cauterization time is \> 2 seconds, sensitive neuromas may form.
> > Use a pyrometer to measure blade temperature, which should be approximately 650°C.
> > Cauterizing blade color may be used as an approximate indicator of temperature (see below). Check blade temperature/color for each machine and operator every hour.
> > Blade temperature variation of up to 40°C is common due to external influences and cannot be detected by the human eye.
> > Use a template with guide plate holes for precision beak trim of different size chicks.
> > Check that beaks have been properly and evenly trimmed.

## Precautions when beak trimming birds:

Water intake is the most important factor in the success of beak trimming. Chicks require immediate and easy access to water.
Do not beak-trim sick or stressed birds.
Do not hurry; handle chicks carefully to prevent errors and poor uniformity.
Provide vitamins and electrolytes containing vitamin K in drinking water 2 days before and 2 days after beak trimming.
Watch chicks after beak trimming to assess stress. Control the ambient temperature until birds appear comfortable and active.
Keep feed at the highest level for several days after beak trimming.
Use only well-trained crews.
Use 360° activated nipples, supplemental chick drinkers and splash cups to encourage drinking. Lower the pressure to make it easy for the chicks to drink.

## Floor Systems Management

## REARING PERIOD

If rearing and laying are to be done in separate houses, use similiar feed and water systems.
From an early age, accustom birds to humans by frequently walking through the house.
Rearing house should have elevated bird platforms with feed and water stations.
Rearing house should have perches.
Solid perches above water and feed lines are preferred.
Flocks housed in all-slat houses during lay should also be grown on slat or wire floors.
Schedule feed lines to run as soon as birds are awake and again after most eggs have been laid.
0-14 day mortality is typically \< 2%.
During rearing and laying, if mortality exceeds 0.1%/ week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.
Remove mortality daily and dispose of properly.

## TRANSFER

The flock can be moved into the laying facility at 15–17 weeks of age.
Complete the vaccination program prior to transfer.
Light hours and light intensity of rearing and laying houses should be matched at transfer.
Light intensity should increase weekly for 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the layer house.
Place females on slats when placing birds in the laying house.
Reduce transfer stress by using water-soluble vitamins, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and probiotics in drinking water 3 days before and 3 days after transfer.
House males in laying facilities before or at the same time as females. (Hy-Line Brown males may be moved a few days earlier to laying house to give them time to acclimate to new environment before arrival of females.)
Establish the correct male to female ratios.
Check every bird and verify correct identification. Check feather color and dubbing in male lines.

## NEST TRAINING

Nest boxes can be placed in the house after brooding and can be parallel or perpendicular to the wall.
Feed lines should not be directly in front of nests.
Starting the day of transfer, open some nest box curtains to encourage nest exploration.
Train females to use nests by frequent morning walks (3–4 times/day) through the house for 8 weeks after birds are moved to the production house.
While walking, move birds away from resting areas, out of corners, away from walls and toward nests.
Automatic nests should open two hours before lights- on and close two hours before lights start to dim.
If using string lights inside the nest, turn on 1 hour before house lights are turned on to attract females. Turn nest lights off 1 hour after house lights come on.
Discontinue nest light usage after 26 weeks of age.
During the first week of laying, leave a few eggs in the nest to encourage females to use nests.
Eliminate dark areas in the laying house to discourage floor eggs.
If local regulations allow, electric deterrent wires can be used to keep birds away from the walls and corners to control floor eggs.
Quickly remove floor eggs.
Be sure all floor eggs are removed before lights go out at night.
Close nests at night.
Keep litter levels to a minimum during the nest training period. Litter deeper than 10 cm results in increased floor eggs and broodiness.

## Nests

Nests should be dark, secluded, warm, and free of air drafts.
Nests should have a well-lit staging area at the entrance to allow for examination and easy access by females.
Avoid barriers to nests, such as drinker lines positioned too low or swinging.

## ASSESSING PULLET QUALITY

Check the physical condition of each bird. Birds with these abnormalities must be euthanized:

Crooked neck
Crow-headed males with little/no comb and wattle development
Hump back
Curled toes
Crossed beak
Crooked keel
Bleeding feathers or feather follicles
Lameness
Foot pad lesions
Low social ranking - feathers pecked
Leg abnormalities
Eye abnormalities (split pupil, tear-drop pupil, eye notch or gray iris)
Body weight 225 g more or below average flock weight
\<\< Back to Table of Contents

## Perches

Perches are essential for rearing birds that will go into an aviary system.
Perches enrich the birds' environment and allow expression of normal behaviors.
Perches encourage jumping habits, which develops leg and breast muscles, increases bone strength, and increases calcium content of bone. Birds able to jump will have better nesting behaviour and be more mobile in multi-tier aviary systems.
Perches reduce social stress by providing safe resting sites.
Perches increase living space in the facility.
Perches allow birds to roost at night.
Use of perches may reduce piling behavior in flocks.

## Perch Design

Floor-reared birds should have access to perches and slats no later than 10 days of age.
Perch height should not exceed 1 m to avoid injuries.
Provide 10–15 cm perch space per bird (check local regulations concerning perch space).
!\[Image description\](A-frame perch design with measurements)
Water line perch Perch over feeder

Separate perch rails by at least 30 cm to prevent cannibalistic pecking of birds on adjacent rails.
Place perches on slats to maintain good litter conditions and control floor eggs.
Avoid slippery perches.
Perches should support the bottom of the foot and be comfortable for the bird.
If possible, use the same perch style in rear and lay facilities.
Do not use perches above water lines during rear if using an electric deterrent over the water line during production.
Perches should be easy to clean and disinfect between flocks.
Seal cracks, crevices, and open ends of pipes to reduce hiding areas for red mites (*Dermanyssus gallinae*).
Perches are ideally placed over feed lines and on the top level in aviaries.
!\[Image description\](Perch in aviary system)
!\[Image description\](Elevated platform)
!\[Image description\](Perch on slats)

## Hy-Line Brown Male Management

The Hy-Line Brown male's 18-week body weight is 2.14–2.31 kg.
The Hy-Line Brown male's adult body weight is 2.64–2.87 kg (40 weeks of age).
The Hy-Line Brown male should preferably not be beak trimmed. If treatment is required, beak treat in hatchery or tip at 7–10 days of age.
Achieving male target body weights during rear is critical for optimum mating behavior and fertility.
Males and females should receive the same feed and lighting schedule.
For breeder cages having a specific male feeder space, these spaces should not be obstructed by nest boxes or other cage enrichments.
Male and female breeders should reach sexual maturity at approximately the same time.
From 0–4 weeks, rear males separately to improve male body weight gain.
!\[Image description\](Red vent is indicative of a working Hy-Line Brown male.)
At 5 weeks, mix males and females. In cages, mix 3–4 females into each male cage. If males appear weaker than females, mix males with females at a 1:1 ratio through the growing period.
Grading males into pens based on body weight can improve male uniformity.
Males and females must be co-mingled during the rearing period to become socialized and avoid mating problems as adults.
Keep extra males in a separate pen; do not mix extra males with females.
Continue culling males as needed during production.
Maintain a mating ratio of 8 males for every 100 females throughout production in floor and cage systems.
Too many males results in more fighting, less mating activity, disruption of social groups and lower fertility.

## MALE EVALUATION – A BEAUTY CONTEST

*Tall, masculine appearance with full red comb* Evaluate males at 10 weeks and at transfer.

Cull roosters with:

Lameness
More than 200 g below target body weight
Curled toes
Foot pad lesions
Poor feathering
Poor beaks
Low social ranking
Hide in nests
Feather pecked

## Artificial Insemination

Artificial insemination can be used for PS in cage housing systems. Roosters and hens are typically housed separately in 1–2 bird cages. Use experienced personnel for semen collection and hen insemination to avoid injury and bird stress.

## Semen Collection from Roosters

One rooster's semen is used for approximately 10 hens.
Do not collect semen from the same rooster more than 2 times per week. Never collect from the same rooster on consecutive days.
Semen without semen extender can be used up to 30 minutes from the first male collected; semen with extender can be refrigerated up to 4 hours.
Semen collection is a two-person operation. To collect semen, hold both legs and position the male with the tail facing the person drawing the semen. Gently massage the male's back (lumbar area) in a downward motion starting at the ribcage and ending at the starting part of the tail.

## Insemination of the Hen

!\[Image description\](Semen collection)
Artificial insemination should begin after a majority (70 to 80%) of the eggs are laid.
Amount of semen to use is 5ml of semen per 125 females, regardless if extender is used. This equals 40 µL semen volume per female.
The insemination procedure is a two-person operation.
Use good quality disposable plastic straws (70 mm) for insemination. Do not attempt to clean and reuse insemination straws.
Trim the feathers around the vent area.
The bird handler should gently remove the hen from the cage and, using thumb and forefinger, spread apart the cloaca, resulting in the turning of the cloaca inside out (everting the oviduct).
The inseminator using an automatic pipette fills the straw with 40 µL of semen and inserts the insemination straw into the exposed (everted) opening to the oviduct to inseminate the hen.

## Good Lighting Practices

In cage housing, measure minimum light intensity at feeder on bottom tier cages, mid-way between lights.
In floor housing, measure minimum light intensity at level of bird's head.
Keep light bulbs and bulb covers clean to prevent loss of light intensity.
Prevent dark areas caused by too much distance between lights or burned out light bulbs.
Shiny or white surfaces reflect light and increase light intensity.
Take local conditions into account which may require adaptations of lighting programs.
Light hours of rearing and production houses should be matched at transfer.
Light intensity should increase 2 weeks before the flock is transferred to the laying house (but not prior to 14 weeks of age). Final rearing house light intensity should match the laying house intensity.
Light stimulation period should extend into peaking period (achieve 16 hours of light at about 25 weeks).

## Light Program for Light-Controlled Housing

Hy-Line Brown breeders require a slower step-down of light hours from 0-9 weeks to prevent early sexual maturity and promote good body weight uniformity.

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Gradual light increases up to 25 weeks of age, 16 hour maximum | | |

Light-controlled houses are those which use light traps around fans and air inlets and complete prevent the ingress of light from the outside. Houses that are not light controlled should use lighting programs for open- sided housing.

An intermittent lighting program for chicks is preferred. If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0-7 days, then use 22 hours of light from 0-3 days and 21 hours of light from 4-7 days.
"Lights on" time can be varied between houses in laying flocks to facilitate egg collection on multiple flock complexes.
If the laying flock has a large spread in hatch ages and/or poor uniformity, light stimulate the flock based on the youngest hatch date or lightest birds.
Use cool lights (\>3500 K) in rearing facility to ensure sufficient blue-green spectrum.
Use warm lights (\<2700 K) in laying flocks to ensure sufficient red spectrum light.

## Lighting Considerations

## FLOOR

Light intensity in the house should be brightest over feeding and resting areas and gradually decrease toward nests.
Avoid dark areas near feeding and resting areas to prevent floor eggs.
| | | Nests | | |
| - | - | ----- | - | - |
| Litter/Scratch | Slats | | Slats | Litter/Scratch |

## CAGES

Alternating the height of lights improves light distribution to all cage levels.
Position lights to minimize bright and dark areas in the house.
!\[Image description\](A cage lighting system with multiple lights hanging from the ceiling)

## Use of Shades in Open-Sided Housing

!\[Image description\](Two images of open-sided housing with shades)
Shades are an effective way to decrease light intensity in an open-sided house.
Keep shades clean and free of dust to allow air flow.
Use stir fans when using shades.
Avoid direct sunlight on birds by using shades or roof overhangs.
Black shades are preferred.
\<\< Back to Table of Contents

## Midnight Feeding / Lighting Program

Optional lighting technique that promotes greater feed consumption
Used whenever more feed intake is desired in rearing or laying flocks
Increases calcium absorption during night when most egg shell is formed
Useful to increase feed intake during peak egg production
Helps maintain feed consumption in hot climates
Midnight feeding may increase feed intake 2–5 g / day per bird

## Good Practices

Initiate the program by turning lights on for 1–2 hours in the middle of the dark period.
There must be at least 3 hours of dark before and after the midnight feeding.
Fill feeders before lights are turned on.
Light provided during the midnight feeding is in addition to regular day length (i.e. 16 hours + midnight feeding).
If midnight feeding is removed, reduce light gradually at a rate of 15 minutes per week.

## Management Events for Parent Stock

WEEKS BODY WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS Arrival • Check body weights.

0-3 weeks • Bulk weigh 10 boxes of 10 chicks.

4-29 weeks • Weigh 100 females and 20 males individually every week. • In houses with cages, weigh birds in the same cages each time for best accuracy. • Calculate uniformity.

30-50 weeks • Weigh 100 females and 50 males individually every 5 weeks. • In houses with cages, weigh birds in the same cages each time for best accuracy. • Calculate uniformity.

Over 50 weeks • Weigh 100 females and 20 males individually every 10 weeks. • In houses with cages, weigh birds in the same cages each time for best accuracy. • Calculate uniformity.

CALCULATING UNIFORMITY • Use individual bird weights. Uniformity calculation tool is available at www.hyline.com.

When handling birds for body weights, assess:

Keel bone—straightness and firmness
Breast muscle score
Body fat
External parasites
Clinical symptoms of disease
Breeder pullet quality
**Bird Handling—BE GENTLE**

Proper handling of birds during body weight measurements, blood collection, selection, vaccination, and transfer will reduce bird stress and prevent injuries
Hold birds by both legs or both wings
Return birds to floor or cage gently—do not drop
Use experienced personnel that have been trained in proper procedures of bird handling
!\[Image description\](Image of a person holding a chicken.)
Hold no more than three birds in one hand.

## **Hatching Egg Care**

## Hatching Egg Collection

Hy-Line PS hatching eggs should weigh a minimum of 50 g from a breeder flock at least 22 weeks of age.
Use only clean eggs collected from nests for hatching.
Hatching eggs should be gathered twice daily. A third collection may be needed during extremely hot weather. In open-sided houses, eggs should be collected at least six times per day.
Eggs should be placed with the air cell up into clean trays or directly onto incubation carts.

## Hatching Egg Identification

Using food colors, mark each egg with the color assigned to each PS line. Each egg must be marked with the assigned color on the top portion of the egg.
Label each egg rack with variety, line and date of collection.

## Hatching Egg Storage

Eggs should be stored at 15–18°C with relative humidity of 65–85%.
!\[Image description\](Unacceptable hatching eggs)
Fumigate hatching eggs prior to storing.
To minimize pre-incubation, eggs should be immediately moved to a temperature and humidity-controlled storage area on the breeder farm with set points equal to the hatchery storage area.
!\[Image description\](Eggs in hatcher trays)
When necessary to save eggs longer than 10 days, store at 13°C with 70–80% humidity or use SPIDES program.

## Fertility Check

## FRESH EGG BREAKOUT

## FERTILITY CHECK AFTER 72 HOURS INCUBATION

!\[Image description\](Fertile Egg. Blood vessels developed and embryo becomes visible)
!\[Image description\](Infertile Egg. No development)
\<\< Back to Table of Contents

## Incubation and Hatching

Pre-warm hatching eggs to achieve maximum chick yield and uniformity of hatch time.
Warm up eggs to a room temperature of 23–25°C and 55% humidity for 8 to 12 hours.
Provide adequate air movement in pre-warming area to reduce condensation and provide uniform temperature to all eggs.
In single-stage incubator, use pre-warm setting.
Under normal conditions, Hy-Line Brown eggs achieve optimum hatch in 21 days and 8 hours.
Egg age affects hatch time. Allow one additional hour of incubation for every day beyond 10 days of egg age.
Chick weight at hatch is directly related to the weight of the hatching egg, usually 66% of egg weight.
Eggs should be grouped in setter according to parent source flock. Maintain these groups so similar size chicks may be placed together in the brooder house.
!\[Image description\](A photo of several newly hatched chicks being held in a person's hands. The chicks are small and covered in soft down. The person's hands are cupped to provide warmth and security for the chicks.)

## Transportation of PS Hatching Eggs (HE) and Day-Old Chicks (DOC)

Use a truck and transporter designed for
transportation of chicks and hatching eggs with
capabilities of heating, cooling and ventilation.
For transporting DOC, the transporter should maintain
an environmental temperature of 26-27°C. Inside
chick boxes, 30-32°C and 50% relative humidity
should be maintained.
For transporting HE, the transporter should maintain
an environmental temperature of 15-18°C.
Precondition the transporter to set the proper
temperature for at least 30 minutes before loading.
!\[Image description\](Hatching egg pallet ready for transportation)
!\[Image description\](Shipping pallets are constructed of preformed spacers that provide strength and airspace around chick boxes.)
Clean and disinfect the transporter between deliveries with verification of cleaniness
by negative laboratory results.
Utilize global positioning system (GPS) monitoring of truck location along the route.

## Transportation of Hatching Eggs (HE)

Packaging materials for boxes and shipment
pallets must be clean, dry, unused and properly
stored.
Always place HE boxes on a pallet during
storage, never directly on the floor.
Do not tip hatching egg boxes at any time
during packing and transportation.
HE boxes should be placed on the shipment
pallet in an alternating pattern for stability. Do
not stack HE boxes more than five high.
The HE shipment pallet should be shrink
wrapped and cargo netted for maximum
stability.
Temperature and humidity recorders are
placed in selected HE boxes to monitor
conditions during transportation.
!\[Image description\](Proper pallet design)
!\[Image description\](Chick box label)

## Transportation of Day-Old Chicks (DOC)

DOC are placed in chick boxes in the hatchery after chick processing.
!\[Image description\](Chick box temperature recorders)
DOC boxes should be placed on a clean, dry pallet and secured with spacers to provide stability and spaces
for ventilation.
Arrange spacers between chick boxes to ensure adequate air flow. DOC boxes and spacers should be
arranged on the pallet so that each DOC box has at least one side open to a larger airspace.
Temperature and humidity recorders are placed in selected chick boxes to monitor conditions during
transportation and chick placement onto the brooding facility. Return temperature recorders to Hy-Line
International promptly for evaluation.
For more information on HE and DOC transportation and pallet contruction, see https://www.uspoultry.org/ communications/AirCargo/24/index.html.

## Feed Biosecurity

No animal sourced feed ingredients should be used in a PS flock due to the risk of pathogen contamination.
Use only ingredients from an approved supplier list, ensuring that the suppliers have an adequate program to control contamination and potential risks.
Maintain a strict policy for visitors to the feed mill following a downtime period matrix between the feed mill and other production facilities.
Introduce a personnel hygiene and clothing policy, with frequent evaluation of its efficacy.
Keep a periodic cleaning (with documentation) of all areas and equipment in the feed mill.
Take periodic environmental swabs of the feedmill and test finished feed for coliforms and *Salmonella*.
Maintain records of the results to establish baselines to identify trends and critical periods.
Keep a clean and a dirty route inside the feed mill grounds.
Feed ingredients and internal feed delivery trucks should never cross routes inside the feed mill.
Heat treatment of finished feed (86°C for 6 minutes) with consecutive chemical and or additive treatment (organic acids, formaldehyde, terpenes, essential oils) is the best way to clean and control subsequent pathogen growth on feed.
Implement a pest control program and maintain with periodic internal and external audits, monitoring of rodenticide bait activity and an action plan in case of deviation.
Bulk feed should be delivered in a clean transport; avoid bagged feed and ingredients as an efficient way to reduce pest infestation.
Audit the feed mill periodically for cleanliness and quality.

## Feed Management

Ideally, each variety should receive its recommended feed formulation.
If two PS varieties are in the same house and it is only possible to have one feed for both, formulate the feed for the variety having the lowest feed intake.
Keep feed retention samples in case an investigation of feed quality is needed.
If a pre-lay diet cannot be used due to multiple flock ages, a developer diet with a higher calcium amount (1.4%) should be used.
Check the consistency of the feed (particle size, excessive powder or moisture, presence of foreign material, odd coloring or smell) between batches and report any changes in the normal appearance to the feed mill.
Ensure that the feed formulas are constantly updated by the attending nutritionist after review of flock production data.
Define acceptable deviations of actual from theoretical ingredient usage and have an action plan in place in case of significant deviation.
Keep production records for a minimum period of one year to allow traceability.
Keep an open channel of communication and a complaint form between farms and feed mill. Ensure that all the complaints are documented and verified.

## Feed Particle Size

A sieve shaker separates feed sample into categories based on particle size.

Use on the farm to check feed particle size from the feed mill—sample taken on delivery or from feed bins.
Use to assess the uniformity of feed particle size throughout the feeding system—samples are taken from various points.

## Too many fine feed particles:

Feed intake and nutrient absorption decreases
Dust in house increases

## Too many coarse feed particles:

Birds selectively eat large particles
Risk of feed separation increases

## Optimal Feed Particle Profile

For more information, see \[Feed Granulometry\](Feed Granulometry).

## Best Practices

A 3–4 hour gap in mid-day feedings allows birds to consume fine particles.
Add a minimum of 1% liquid oil / fat in meal diets to incorporate and retain small particles in feed.
Use larger particle size meal or crumble to increase intakes in hot climates.

## Vitamins and Trace Minerals

As the vitamin/trace mineral premix is often found in fine feed particles, a minimum level of 1% added liquid oil/fat in diets binds small particles in feed.

¹ Minimum recommendations for rearing and laying periods. Local regulations may limit dietary content of individual vitamins or minerals. Levels of 150-200mg/kg of Vitamin C can be beneficial during periods of stress. ² Store premixes according to supplier's recommendations and observe 'use by' dates to ensure vitamin activity is maintained. Inclusion of antioxidant may improve premix stability. ³ Vitamin and mineral recommendations vary according to activity. ⁴ Where heat treatment is applied to diet, higher levels of vitamins may be required. Consult with vitamin supplier regarding stability through individual production processes. ⁵ A proportion of Vitamin D3 can be supplemented as 25-hydroxy D3 according to supplier's recommendations and applicable limits. ⁶ Higher levels of Niacin are recommended in non-cage systems. ⁷ Greater bioavailability and productivity may be possible with use of chelated mineral sources.

## Water Quality

Water is the most important nutrient. Good quality water must be available to birds at all times.
Water and feed consumption are directly related- when birds drink less, they consume less feed and production quickly declines.
As a general rule, healthy birds will consume 1.5– 2.0 times more water than feed. This ratio increases in high ambient temperatures.
Test water quality at least 1 time per year. The water source will determine regularity of water testing.
Surface water requires more frequent testing, as it is more affected by season and rainfall patterns.
Closed wells taking water from aquifers or deep artesian basins will be more consistent in water quality, but are generally higher in dissolved mineral content.
The presence of coliform bacteria is an indicator that water source has been contaminated with animal or human waste.
When collecting a well water sample, let water run for 2 minutes prior to collecting the sample. Water samples should be kept below 10°C and submitted to the lab in less than 24 hours.
Some water sources contain high levels of dissolved minerals such as calcium, sodium and magnesium. When this occurs, amounts of these minerals in water have to be considered when formulating feed.
Ideal water pH is 5–7 to promote good water sanitation, increase feed consumption and improve upper gastrointestinal health.
Less than optimum water quality can have a significant impact on gut health which will lead to under utilization of nutrients in feed.

¹ All nutrient requirements are based on the feed ingredient table at the back of this guide.

² Do not feed Pre-Lay Diet earlier than 15 weeks of age. Do not feed Pre-Lay later than first egg as it contains insufficient calcium to support egg production. Implementing a pre-lay diet can be challenging in mixed-age flocks. If it's not possible to use the Pre-Lay diet, the calcium content of the last stage rearing diet (developer) must be increased to 1.4%.

³ Recommended energy range is based on raw material energy values shown in feed ingredient table at back of this guide. It is important that target concentrations of dietary energy are adjusted according to energy system applied to raw material matrix.

⁴ Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed.

⁵ Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw materials used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only.

⁶ Calcium should be supplied as fine calcium carbonate (mean particle size less than 2 mm). Coarse limestone (2–4 mm) can be introduced in Pre-Lay Diet at up to 50% of total limestone.

⁷ Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.

⁸ Oil levels can be increased to 2.0% in starter diets when given as a mash to control dust and increase feed palatability.

Avoid excessive body weight gain after 12 weeks.

1 All nutrient requirements are based on the feed ingredient table at the back of this guide.

2 Crude protein, methionine+cystine, fat, linoleic acid, and/or energy may be changed to optimize egg size.

3 Peaking nutrient levels are calculated for birds at peak egg production. Prior to achieving peak egg production, the nutrient requirements will be lower.

4 A good approximation of the influence of temperature on energy needs is that for each 0.5°C change higher or lower than 22°C, subtract or add about 2 kcal /bird / day, respectively.

5 Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed.

* Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only.

7 Calcium and available phosphorus requirements are determined by flock age. When production remains higher and diets are fed for longer than ages shown, it is recommended to increase to calcium and phosphorus concentrations of next feeding phase.

• Calcium carbonate particle size recommendation varies throughout lay. Refer to Calcium Particle Size Table. Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility.

9 Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.

## Biosecurity

Disease outbreaks jeopardize the ability of the PS operation to fulfill the health requirements for PS chicks. Parent stock must be kept in strictly biosecure locations. Biosecurity is the best method of avoiding diseases. Monitoring programs should be in place to confirm that the PS flock is free of all diseases under regulation by both the importing and exporting countries. All flocks should be free of important vertically transmitted diseases like *Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae,* salmonellas, lymphoid leucosis and others under regulation. Parent flocks receive regular veterinary inspections and confirmed free of clinical signs of disease.

## Facility Biosecurity *(All visitors should be verified as salmonella negative prior to entering the farm)*

| TO/ FROM | PS Farms | Hatchery, Feed Mill |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza areas or Exotic Newcastle affected areas | 7 nights | 7 nights |
| Other Poultry Farms | 4 nights | 4 nights |
| Industry Convention\* (with other poultry farmers or international attendees) | 1 night | 1 night |
| Lab Building, Office | Same Day\*\* | Same Day\*\* |
| Salmonella Positive Locations | 3 nights | 3 nights |
| PS Farms, Egg Transfer | Same Day\*\* | Same Day\*\* |
| Hatchery, Feed Mill | 1 night | |

\*\*MUST traffic from youngest to oldest flocks and/or healthy to sick flocks. Visit fewer than four (4) PS flocks per day, assuring youngest to oldest flock movement. +Including backyard flocks - petting zoos, county and state fairs, agricultural shows, farm stores, any type of birds/poultry flock Night = Nights in the country of the PS farm or hatchery to be visited, with a change of clothes and shower off site.

## Biosecurity *(continued)*

## People and Equipment

Allow only essential visitors onto PS farm; provide a questionanaire to ensure biosecurity compliance.
Visits to the PS farm should be documented in a logbook.
All workers and visitors must shower at the farm and change into clean farm clothes, hair net and footwear before entering the biosecure area.
Visitor access requires providing negative *Salmonella* results and documented approval of director in charge.
Visitor and employee vehicles must park outside the biosecure area.
Do not use outside crews or equipment for vaccination, moving birds, beak trimming, or manure removal.
Outside equipment and materials must be disinfected before entering the farm and stored in insect- and rodent-proof storage.

## Clean Road

Restrict access.
Feed, pullets, and materials should enter by clean road.
All delivery vehicles should go through truck wash or make deliveries off site.
Feed delivery trucks do not enter the biosecure area. Feed should be augured from the delivery truck over the farm perimeter fence. Farm dedicated vehicles deliver feed to the PS house silos.

## Dirty Road

Use dirty road for manure, litter, dead birds, and moving out end-of-lay hens.

## Feed

Use good quality, tested feed ingredients.
Use heat treatment (preferred) or chemical treatment of feed for control of *Salmonella* and coliform bacteria.
Do not use animal source proteins.
Control traffic and truck sanitation to mill.

## Farm Construction

Use smooth, impermeable materials whenever possible.
Build in drains for easy washing.
Use gravel or concrete outside the buildings to help control rodents.
Houses should be designed to prevent exposure to wild birds, insects and rodents.

## Entry into Bird Area

Clean foot baths containing disinfectant should be placed outside entries to all poultry houses.
A second change of footwear is required before entering the bird area.
Workers should be limited to a single house.

## Farm Design

A single-aged PS farm using an all-in, all-out principle is best to prevent transmission of disease.
Use a perimeter fence around the farm to exclude livestock and traffic, and to mark the biosecure area of the farm.
Use dedicated vehicles inside the clean area.
Utilize deterrents to exclude wild birds.
Use footbaths or shoe changes with Danish-style entry at each house.

## Dead Bird Disposal

Quickly and properly dispose of dead chickens daily.
Dispose of dead birds by rendering, incineration, or composting.
Freeze dead birds if they will be disposed off-site.

## Water

Ensure good quality and sufficient quantity of water.
Test twice annually.
Treat water as necessary.
Sanitize water lines routinely.
Maintain pH at appropriate levels.

## Rodents

Rodents are known carriers of many poultry diseases and the most common reason for re- contamination of a cleaned and disinfected poultry facility. They are also responsible for house-to- house spread of disease on a farm.
The farm should be free of debris, tall grass and other places that could harbor rodents.
The perimeter of each house should have a 1 m wide area of crushed rock or concrete to prevent rodents from burrowing into the house.
Feed and eggs should be stored in rodent-proof areas.
Bait stations should be placed around the perimeter of the house as well as throughout the house, and maintained with fresh rodenticide.
Fill all gaps in the entrances, walls and roof which could provide rodent access into the poultry house.
For more information, see "Code of Practice for the Prevention of Rodent Infestation on Poultry Farms." \<\< Back to Table of Contents

## Vaccination Recommendations

Certain diseases are too widespread or difficult to eradicate and require a routine vaccination program. In general, all breeder flocks should be vaccinated against Marek's disease, Newcastle disease (NDV), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD or Gumboro), chicken anemia virus (CAV), avian encephalomyelitis (AE), and fowl pox. Other vaccinations are added to the program as local disease challenges dictate. **A single program cannot be recommended for all regions.** **Follow label instructions provided by the vaccine manufacturer.** **Use only approved vaccines.** **Consult with local veterinarians to determine the best vaccination program for your area.**

## BASIC BREEDER VACCINE APPLICATIONS

| WEEKS OF AGE | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | |
| ------------ | - | - | - | - | - | -- | -- | -- | -- | - |
| IBD, Gumboro | | | | | | | | | | - Given between days 15–18, 21–25, 28–32, IBD live vaccinations based on maternal antibody decline and field challenge - Drinking water vaccination preferred - IBD immune vaccine complex |
| Newcastle disease, moderate challenge areas, no velogenic Newcastle present | | | | | | | | | | - 2–3 live vaccinations, allow 4–6 weeks between last live vaccination and injected inactivated vaccine |
| Newcastle disease, high challenge areas, velogenic Newcastle present | | AND | | | | | | | AND | - Simultaneous live (eye drop) and inactivated vaccine provides good protection in high challenge areas - Live boosting vaccinations every 30–60 days during production period may be needed to maintain high immunity |
| Infectious bronchitis | | | | | | | | | | - Use Newcastle-bronchitis combination vaccines - 2–3 live vaccinations using multiple IB serotypes build cross- protective immunity (if serotypes have been identified in the area) - Last live vaccination should be administered as a spray - Live boosting vaccinations every 30–60 days during production period may be needed to maintain high immunity |
| Avian encephalomyelitis | | | | | | OR | | | | - Given once between 6 and 15 weeks to prevent tremor in chicks as well as egg drops in breeder hens - Given via drinking water or often combined with fowl pox vaccine as a wing-web inoculation - Do not give live AE vaccines within 4 weeks of hatching egg collection - Flocks should be confirmed as AE-antibody positive before using hatching eggs; if negative, revaccinate and retest until positive |
| Fowl pox | | | | | | | | | | - 1 or 2 vaccinations - Vaccination in birds less than 6 weeks should use highly attenuated fowl pox vaccine or pigeon pox - Use pigeon pox with fowl pox to provide better cross-protection - Most outbreaks due to poor vaccination technique - For more information, see Fowl Pox in Layers |
| Chicken anemia virus | | | | | | OR | | | | - May be given in drinking water - May be combined with fowl pox and given as wing-web vaccination - Vaccinate at least 4 weeks before egg production - Breeder flocks should be confirmed as CAV-antibody positive before using the hatching eggs; if negative, revaccinate and retest until positive |
