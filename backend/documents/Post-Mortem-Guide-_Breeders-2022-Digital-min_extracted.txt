# Cobb On-Farm Guide

## Post-Mortem of Broiler Breeders

www.cobb-vantress.com This guide is a reference for farm post-mortem examinations of broiler breeders intended for use by farm managers.

It will provide information on the normal anatomy of broiler breeders and indicates primary areas of focus when doing a field post-mortem.

The guide illustrates the most common method of performing a post-mortem examination on broiler breeders.

## User Notes

This post-mortem guide was created using healthy broiler breeder chickens that were humanely euthanized and then bled. As a result, the color and appearance of certain organs may be pale or flaccid.

This is not a diagnostic tool and only intended to be a guide for staff in the field to help relay issues they are seeing on the farm.

In case of abnormalities in the flock or observations from a post-mortem, always consult your veterinarian before taking any further actions.

Throughout the guide, you will see a quick response (QR) code.

## 1.1 Reasons for Conducting a Post-Mortem

A post-mortem dissection (necropsy) of a broiler breeder is a procedure used by veterinarians, farm managers, or growers to investigate mortality of birds in a flock. First, an external visual exam is conducted for any obvious outward signs indicating the cause of death. Next, an internal visual examination is conducted to obtain further diagnostic information. Samples can be collected and sent to a laboratory for diagnostic tests.

Conducting a post-mortem on a regular basis can help provide insightful information about incidental flock mortality, be a very useful assessment to provide feedback on poultry health programs, and be an important diagnostic tool when a disease is suspected in a flock. A good way to proceed is to do a post- mortem of all the mortality on a specific day and repeat this process on a weekly basis. Findings from the routine post-mortems can be tracked in a graph with the results grouped into categories. Evaluation and tracking post- mortem findings will provide information regarding potential improvements to the flock health and management program that can help reduce future mortality.

**A post-mortem is recommended if**:

✓ There is a rise in mortality or culling
✓ There is a rise in the number of ill birds or disease is suspected
✓ For quality control purposes
Chapter 2 of this guide provides guidance for sampling techniques. A veterinarian and/or a diagnostic laboratory can provide additional information on sampling techniques and shipping methods for diagnostic testing.

## 1.2 Bird Sampling for a Post-Mortem

When mortality is unusually high, a post- mortem exam should be conducted on birds that are recently deceased. A recently dead or euthanized bird can be refrigerated if a post- mortem cannot be conducted immediately. It is not recommended to conduct a post-mortem on a non-refrigerated bird that has been dead for more than several hours because decomposition may make diagnosis difficult.

If the goal is to understand the main cause of **incidental mortality**, then it is best to look at all the dead birds for a given day and repeat the process on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. It is important to repeat the post-mortem regularly. Repeating the process regularly and graphing the data provides a better understanding of the main cause of mortality which, in turn, allows targeted adjustments to a management program.

If a bird is ill or a disease is suspected in the flock, make notes of your observations prior to euthanizing. Include observations regarding breathing patterns, posture, feather ruffling, discharge from the nose or eyes, general bird condition and appearance, and bird mobility. Also make notes regarding general flock distribution and behavior within the house, any unusual sounds (i.e., coughing or snicking), and any unusual fecal observations.

## 2.1 Collecting Flock History and Health

To understand mortality, it is critical to **collect as much historical information** about the flock as possible. This information will support an accurate diagnosis. An example of a flock history record form is given in chapter 8 of this guide. The form has some specific information requested such as age, breed or line, vaccinations and medications delivered. It is helpful to provide notes on management practices, feed form, and water consumption. Additionally, disease characteristics such as recurring issues and mortality patterns should be noted.

Closely examine the live birds in the house prior to the post-mortem if the issue or disease appears to afflict most of the flock. Make note of the **flock health and history** (see chapter 8 for an example form) that includes the general appearance of birds (feathering, weight, body condition, pigmentation), the incidence of any injuries, appearance of fecal and cecal droppings, respiratory characteristics (discharge, inflammation, breathing patterns), skeletal issues, and any other abnormalities (behavioral observations, flock distribution and activity level, etc.).

Collecting the flock health and history information will also provide direction about **which samples to collect**. The numbers and types of samples can be narrowed to save time, money and provide a more accurate diagnosis. Give your veterinarian the flock health and history information and they can help you narrow the sample list. The following sections will provide guidance on identifying, labeling, packaging, and shipping samples to optimize avian health testing.

!\[Image description\](A man in a dark environment is writing on a clipboard.)

## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance

Primary reasons to collect samples during a post-mortem are:

✔ to verify the absence or presence of an infectious disease agent within the flock
✔ to verify the application of vaccine(s) and to confirm flock immunity after vaccination
✔ to confirm organ development or irregular post-mortem findings
Primary samples that may be collected from birds for diagnostic testing include:

✔ Blood
✓ Cleft palate, tracheal or choanal swabs
✓ Feces
✔ Organ or tissue

## Quality and quantity

✔ Good quality and correct quantity are required so the lab can use the sample(s) to complete diagnostic testing efficiently and accurately. Bad quality samples will cause questionable test results.
✓ Inadequate sample quantity will not provide enough material to accurately conduct diagnostics.
✓ Inadequate number of samples submitted or samples that do not represent the flock can lead to incorrect assumptions about the immunity or health status of the flock.
!\[Image description\](Cobb logo.)

## Identification

✓ Correct label and sample identification are required so that the lab can conduct testing and report results directly to the correct location, production manager, and veterinarian.
✓ Poorly labelled samples lead to poor traceability and may delay the result report.
✔ If no label is provided, the sample may be discarded by the lab.

## Packaging and timing of sample shipment

✓ Correct packaging and good timing for shipment reduces the risk of sample spoilage and possibility of testing delays.
✔ Poor packaging increases the risk of sample contamination, damage, and spoilage.
✓ If samples are submitted late, results may be received too late to reduce the biosecurity risk for the flock or farm.
✓ Samples degrade over time and samples that are held too long have poor quality and cannot be used for testing.

## Storing a portion of the sample

✓ For blood samples, it is recommended to store a portion of the serum from the blood sample for the life of the flock. This can be very helpful as a reference sample.

## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance

Blood samples are routinely collected from flocks to test for poultry diseases and verify the immune response (titers) of the flock following vaccination. During a post-mortem session, blood may also be collected for these testing reasons:

Specific testing methodology, amount of
blood needed, equipment required, etc. should
be specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or
company QA department.
To test for disease freedom, blood may be
used to test for Mycoplasma, Avian Influenza (Al),
and Salmonella and other diseases that are not
included in the vaccination program.
To verify immune response (titers), blood may
be collected prior to and several weeks after the
vaccination of the broiler breeder flock. To verify
the immune response and the uniformity of
antibody response to the vaccine(s), ELISA tests
are traditionally used to verify the titer level or
sero-conversion in birds post-vaccination.
For live vaccines, collect blood approximately
3 weeks after vaccination.
For inactivated (killed) vaccines, collect blood
approximately 4 to 5 weeks after vaccination.
To test for specific concerns (i.e., toxins, blood
chemistry profile, etc.), blood may be collected to
verify the health status of the bird(s) and to identify
any specific concerns.
Fecal samples may be requested as a follow-up to other testing (environmental swab) or may be used for routine monitoring during post-mortem evaluations to assess the gastro-intestinal health of the flock. Specific sampling methodology and amount needed should be specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or company QA department.

To test for disease freedom, litter or fecal samples
may be used to test for *Salmonella*.
To test for intestinal parasites, fecal samples may
be collected at specific times to verify if there
is a coccidial or worm infestation that may be
challenging the flock.

## 2.2 Sample Collection Guidance

!\[Image description\](Cobb logo)
Cleft palate, tracheal or choanal swabs are routinely collected from flocks to test for respiratory diseases. These swabs can be part of the post- mortem evaluation and diagnostic process and can be collected pre or post-euthanasia. Precise testing methodology, number of birds to sample per airspace or barn, tools and supplies required should be specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or company QA department.

To test for disease freedom, cleft palate or
tracheal swabs may be used to test for Infectious
Laryngotracheitis (ILT), Avian Influenza (AI),
Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), or Mycoplasma
gallisepticum (MG). Cloacal swabs can be used to
test for Avian Influenza (Al) and Infectious Bursal
Disease (IBD).
To test for Infectious Bronchitis (IB) or Infectious
Bursal Disease (IBD) challenges, choanal swabs
may be collected for testing.
Swabs may be required after suspect blood
results from routine screening tests for
respiratory disease, when abnormal respiratory
signs are seen in a flock, and during situations
when there is an increased risk of an infectious
avian respiratory disease in the immediate area
near the flock or farm.
Organ or tissue samples may be collected to test for various poultry diseases or to examine any pathological or histological changes in the tissue.

Specific sampling methodology (which tissues
are needed, how much tissue, quantity of birds
to sample, etc.), the method of tissue submission
and storage (fixed tissue, fresh tissue, or frozen
tissue) and any additional requirements should
be specified by the veterinarian, laboratory or
company QA department.
Samples may be taken from recently-dead
birds or from birds that have recently been
euthanized. Samples should not be collected
from deteriorating carcasses or decomposing
birds.
For fresh samples, the tissue or organ should be
placed in a sample bag and kept cool (refrigerator
or cooler) immediately after collection and until
samples arrive at the lab.

## Euthanasia

## 3.1 Euthanasia Definition and Goals

Euthanasia is defined\* as a "method of killing that minimizes pain, distress, and anxiety experienced by the animal prior to loss of consciousness and causes rapid loss of consciousness followed by cardiac or respiratory arrest and death." For a post-mortem process, if live poultry are used, birds must be euthanized to evaluate the internal organs.

## These key factors should be achieved for euthanasia:

✓ a process that minimizes pain, anxiety, and distress of the bird prior to loss of consciousness
✓ a rapid loss of consciousness and an irreversible, efficient death of the bird
✓ a procedure that is humane and completed with respect to the bird being euthanized, and
✓ a method that can be completed by competent and trained staff.
\*The current definition is from the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals, 2020 Edition available at: (https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/ Guidelines-on-Euthanasia-2020.pdf) The method of euthanasia used for an individual chicken should be selected with regards to:

✓ the location where the evaluation will take place (i.e., farm or laboratory)
✓ the focus of the post-mortem and if any specific organs or samples are required
✓ the age and size of bird and number of birds to be euthanized
✓ personnel involved (training, compliance, skill) and safety considerations
✓ the availability of euthanasia equipment
✓ national poultry or regulatory guidelines for euthanasia that may restrict the method(s) used.

## 3.2 Manual Euthanasia

1. Hold the bird securely by both legs (between the hocks and feet).
2. Place your other hand at the base of the chicken's head.
3. Gently pull the head toward your knee and rotate your wrist/hand so that you will dislocate the neck at the point where the head and neck meet.
4. Check to verify that the technique was effective by feeling for the gap in the neck.
!\[Image description\](Diagram showing the manual euthanasia of a chicken. The diagram is split into four steps. Step 1 shows a hand holding the chicken by both legs. Step 2 shows another hand holding the base of the chicken's head. Step 3 shows an arrow indicating the direction to pull the head. Step 4 shows a close-up of the chicken's head, with an arrow indicating the gap in the neck.)

## **External Visual Examination**

Inspect the external physical characteristics of the bird:

1. Feathers
• coverage
• cleanliness
• condition
2. Head condition
• eyes
• ears
• nostrils
• beak
• comb
• wattle
3. Skin condition and integrity

## 4.1 Feathers

1. Feathers can be inspected on live or recently culled birds. Inspect the feathers on the body. Check feathers for:
✓ Coverage
✓ Cleanliness
✓ Condition
2. Extend the wings and check the primary feathers for shape and abnormalities.
3. Inspect the feathers for stress marks.
4. Inspect feathers for growth gaps.

## 4.2 Skin Condition and Integrity

Check the skin for

✓ Signs of external parasites (mites, lice, etc.)
✓ Scratches or other injuries
✓ Dehydration (dehydrated birds will have dry skin and elevated scales on the legs; older dehydrated birds will have a dry, scaly comb).
Foot of hydrated bird Feathered Areas Depluming Mite - burrows into feather shaft causes birds to pull out feathers.

Vent Region Foot of dehydrated bird Poultry Lice - tiny, yellow colored. Egg clusters are attached at the base of feather shafts.

Fowl Mite Black, dirty, feathers caused by accumulation of mite droppings and dried blood.

Under Wing Fowl Tick - tiny tick that sticks to skin and causes red spots.

Legs and Feet Scaly Leg Mite raised, uneven, crusty and/or thickening scales.

## 4.3 Feet, Legs, and Skeletal Health

Evaluate the condition of the feet (foot pads, toes and toenails). Inspect for any litter or manure accumulation, ulcers, and foot or toe damage. Inspect the legs for overall health condition.
Take the weight of the legs with your index finger. With your thumb feel for hard nodules or inflammations in the Achilles tendon.
Check for swelling of the hock joint.
Evaluate leg straightness. Hold the legs at the natural width for the frame size of each individual bird. Holding the legs either too far apart or too close together will make them appear crooked.

## 4.3 Feet, Legs, and Skeletal Health

1. The keel bone is the pronounced bone that extends from the sternum and runs axially over the midline. It is located ventral to the heart and anchors the muscles used for wing motion (pectoralis major and pectoralis minor). Palpate the keel bone and inspect it for curvatures or bends.
2. The keel bone also can be visually inspected after euthanasia and breast skin removal.
!\[Image description\](An image shows two close-up views of a chicken's keel bone area. The top image shows the exterior shape of the bone with a dotted line indicating its curvature. The bottom image shows a similar view, possibly after skin removal, with a dotted line highlighting the keel bone's position.)

## 4.4 Head Condition

## Head

Check the head for any swelling

## Eyes and Ears

Check eyes and ears for redness, swelling and discharge.

## Nostrils and Beak

Check the beak shape. Check the beak, internally and externally including the corners for abnormalities such as lesions from mycotoxins.
Check the nostrils for blockages and buildup of materials. Apply pressure to the top of the nostril to check for mucus.

## Comb and Wattle

Observe the size and color of the wattle and comb relative to age. (See following page for examples of comb and wattle appearance at different ages.)

## 4.5 Development and Body Condition

## Body weight

Weigh the bird. Record and compare the weight to what is expected for the age, sex, and line.
Verification of the body weight and documentation of body condition (fleshing and fat deposition) of birds are recommended as part of the flock evaluation process and post-mortem session. For example, post-mortem sessions can allow farm managers and veterinarians to verify possible biological reasons for underweightbirds or those that have inadequate fleshing and/or fat deposition. Conversely, if broiler breeders are overweight and over-conditioned (excessive fleshing and fat scores) during a post-mortem session, this may help explain mortality during the onset of egg production and fertility concerns in a broiler breeder flock.

## 4.5 Development and Body Condition

## Fleshing, Fat Deposition and Uniformity - Females

Evaluate the fleshing and fat deposition for each individual bird.
Use the chart to determine if flesh score is correct for the bird's age.
Palpate the pelvic bone to assess fat accumulation. Hens (in the production phase) may have visible fat
deposition underneath the skin on the bottom (ventral) portion of each wing. Parallel to this fat deposit
is a large blood vessel. This combination is often referred to as the fat vein. The fat vein can be used
to determine subcutaneous fat deposition. Fat accumulation can also be visually inspected during the
internal examination.
| Optimum Fleshing Score and Pelvic Fat for Females Given as Age and Percentage of Flock within Each Score | Age (weeks) | 2 | 3 | 4 | Pelvic Fat |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | - | - | - | ---------- |

| ---------- | - | - |
| | Very wide breast (dimple in keel area). Severely over fleshed male for all the male lines. Fertility would be negatively affected. | Excessive |

## 4.6 Cloaca and Tail

## Cloaca and Tail

Inspect the cloaca. Check for a pasty vent (cloaca) and accumulation of urate deposits. For males, check the color (redness) for active breeding roosters (see section 5.7 for more photos and information).
Inspect the tail. The tail should be well- feathered. Any signs of tail pecking can be an indication of stress, high density, or nutritional deficiencies.

## Post-Mortem Internal Visual Examination

## 5.1 Examination Sequence

1. It is recommended to wet the carcass using water containing a disinfectant after euthanasia to keep feathers and down from interfering with the post-mortem examination.

2. Remove the breast skin 3. Subdermal and femoral head exam 4. Examine the legs 5. Examine the head and neck region 6. Examine the thoracic cavity and coelomic cavity (space where internal organs are suspended).

3. Examine the reproductive organs

!\[Image description\](Cobb logo)

## 5.2 Subdermal and Femoral Head Examination

Remove the skin from the breast.
!\[Image description\](Image of a hand removing the skin from a chicken's breast, labeled with the number 1.)
Examine the keel and breast to check the condition of the bird and check for any abnormalities (i.e. crooked keel; irregular color of the breast). Note fleshing and breast shape.
!\[Image description\](Image of a chicken's breast with the keel and breast visible, labeled with the number 2.)
Support the carcass and elevate the leg to 90 degrees. Pull the leg from the joint (for older birds) or pop the femoral head out (for younger birds) by pressing the thigh down and towards the back of the carcass.
!\[Image description\](Image of a hand supporting a chicken's leg and thigh, labeled with the number 3.)
Inspect the femoral head. A normal, healthy femoral head is shown in the photo.
!\[Image description\](Image of a femoral head of a chicken, labeled with the number 4.)
Remove the skin from the legs and sides of the breast. Inspect the muscle revealed after the skin was removed. Look for any hemorrhages in the thigh muscles (i.e., lesion due to a mycotoxin issue, injury or disease like infectious bursal disease (IBD)).

## Growth Plates

Check the growth plate and bone integrity by slicing through the proximal end of the tibia (end away from the foot). Always slice the bone away from your hand that is grasping the leg and never towards your hand. *Slicing towards your hand can cause a serious injury!*
!\[Image description\](Image of leg examination procedure (1))
!\[Image description\](Image of leg examination procedure (2))
It will be necessary to slice through the bone several times to see the internal features.
The growth plates should have a uniform thickness. Be sure to check growth plates on both legs as it is possible to have one normal and one abnormal growth plate.

cavity, tongue and under the tongue
for any abnormalities (such as ulcers
due to mycotoxins). Examine the
tongue for necrosis and diphtheria by
toxins or pox. Take note of any raised
or discolored areas. The mucosal
surfaces are normally very uniform
in color and appearance.

## Crop

Feed enters the mouth and goes straight to the crop. The feed is held here for stabilization and storage. It then passes to the proventriculus where digestive enzymes are added. The crop is where the breakdown of feed starts.
Examine the crop for size (correct based on age and weight) and cut the crop to examine the inside. Evaluate the contents of the crop (i.e., feed, litter, etc.) and look for irregularities on the internal surface of the crop (i.е., fungal growth). A fungal infection by Candida can cause whitish, thickened patches inside the crop.

Exposing the Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region

Snip the tissue at the tip of the sternum to open the thoracic (chest) cavity and coelomic (abdominal) region.
Cut along the edge of the breast, cutting through the muscle and the ribs. Try to avoid damaging the liver, intestines and gall bladder with your knife or scissors.
Gently raise the breast plate to reveal the liver and heart.
Cut through the shoulder to remove the breast plate. Move the breast plate to the side or remove it completely so that you can inspect the organs. Be careful not to cut the trachea.

## 5.5 Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region

Liver, Spleen, Gall Bladder

Examine the liver. It is the first organ where the absorbed
nutrients pass. The liver is a filter (detoxifier). Liver color
can vary based on the diet and age of the bird. Chicks
typically have a yellow liver (due to yolk absorption) while
older birds have a dark red liver as shown here. Look
for a difference in color, spots and inflammation of the
capsule around the liver (perihepatitis). The edges of the
liver should be well-defined. Samples of the liver can be
collected using swabs (as seen in the photo) or a small
amount of irregular liver tissue can be placed in a sample
jar to submit to the lab.
Elevate the corner of the liver to view the gall bladder. The
gall bladder releases bile fluid into the digestive tract to
support fat digestion. The normal color of the gall bladder
should be dark green. A large gall bladder would indicate
a high level of hemoglobin turnover.
Remove the liver with gall bladder and spleen attached.
The spleen is a small, round, soft organ similar in color to
the liver. The spleen is normally about 1 inch (2.5 to 3.0 cm)
long and is about the size of a large olive. Enlargement of
the spleen may indicate a high production of lymphocytes
in response to an infection.
A swab can be used to sample the liver Liver Spleen Gall Bladder Spleen Liver Gall Bladder Scan to access supplementary materials

Air Sacs, Lungs, Ribs

After the heart and liver have been evaluated, grasp the gizzard with your left hand and pull it to the left to reveal the intestines, abdominal air sacs and remaining internal organs. Air sacs should be clear and free of exudate.
!\[Image description\](Photograph of the internal organs of a bird, labeled with '1' and an arrow pointing to 'Air Sacs'.)
The lungs are firmly attached to the ribs in the upper thoracic cavity under the heart.
!\[Image description\](Photograph of the internal organs of a bird, labeled with '2'. Labels indicate 'Breast plate', 'Heart', 'Liver', and 'Lung'.)
The lungs should be a bright pink/red color (as shown in the photo), without signs of inflammation. Normal lung tissue is spongy and no nodules or irregular texture should be palpated.
!\[Image description\](Photograph of a healthy lung labeled '3'.)
Remove the lungs on each side to view the ribs. Check the shape and spacing of the ribs for uniformity. Abnormal findings may include bead like pearls on the ends of the ribs (i.e., rickets). This photo indicates normal rib appearance.

## Gizzard, Proventriculus

After the liver is removed, the proventriculus and gizzard are clearly visible. The proventriculus is where enzymes are mixed with the feed and digestion continues.
Remove the gizzard and proventriculus. Open each organ and inspect them. The photo shows a normal color and texture of the proventriculus and the gizzard.
The gizzard grinds food and is a very strong muscle. In the photo the koilin membrane (lining of the gizzard) has been removed. Check the gizzard for erosions and ulcerations. An erosion is a lesion only present in the membrane (koilin layer). An ulceration is a lesion that has eroded through the lining to the muscle layer of the gizzard.

## 5.5 Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region

## Intestines

The duodenum, jejunum and ileum are classed as the small intestine. The duodenum is the most efficient at breaking down nutrients but more absorption takes place in the jejunum and ileum due to the larger surface area.
Remove the intestinal tract and examine. The pancreas is in the center of the loop of the duodenum and is normally a pale color (as shown in this photo). The pancreas secretes enzymes and pH neutralizers into the duodenum for further breakdown of nutrients.
Meckel's diverticulum (yolk sac absorption site) marks the end of the jejunum and the start of the ileum. In young birds, the yolk from the egg is absorbed here. Evaluate meckel's diverticulum for yolk sac retention. This picture indicates a normal sized meckel's diverticulum. A large meckel's diverticulum is indicative of a poorly absorbed yolk sac in young birds.
!\[Image description\](Diagram of the intestinal tract of a bird, labeled with anatomical features. Image 1 shows the intestinal tract. Image 2 shows the pancreas, jejunum, duodenal loop and illeum. Image 3 shows the Meckel's diverticulum, ceca, rectum and cloaca.)

## 5.5 Thoracic Cavity and Coelomic Region

## Intestines

Use scissors to open the length of the intestinal tract in order (duodenum to ceca) to examine the intestinal content and texture.
Evaluate the opened intestinal tract for color, content and mucus presence. Mucus protects the intestinal wall from being infected with pathogens inside the lumen.
In a normal healthy bird the intestine should be pale in color.
An abnormal finding might include the presence of hemorrhages, irregular color or thickness of the ingesting, and irregular texture of the mucosal lining of the intestine.

## Ceca, Cecal Tonsils

The ceca are located where the small and large intestines join. They are only emptied on average 1 to 2 times a day. The ceca droppings can be seen on the floor of the poultry house and are a softer, stickier and more watery in consistency than a 'normal' dropping. Sizes may vary among birds. There is one pair of ceca. The ceca are blind pouches (they do not connect to another point).
Use scissors to open the ceca to examine the contents.
The cecal tonsils are at the joint between the ceca and large intestines. The cecal tonsils are lymph nodules and will respond to an infection. Evaluate cecal tonsils for cleanliness and size. Normal cecal tonsils should be clean and without red inflammation.
Abnormal cecal tonsils may be red and/or inflamed (swollen).
!\[Image description\](Illustration of the ceca and cecal tonsils in poultry with labels: 'Small intestine', 'Cecum', 'Large intestine', 'Normal fecal dropping with white urate cap', 'Normal cecal dropping', 'Normal Cecal Tonsils (no swelling, pale in color)', 'Abnormal Cecal Tonsils (note inflammation and redness)'.)

Kidneys, Ureters

The kidneys are located under the intestinal tract in a fixed position on either side of the backbone (vertebral column). The kidneys should be symmetrical in appearance and consist of 3 lobules (cranial, middle and caudal) on each side. They should be flat, firm and light purple (similar to the photo). They should not show any signs of blood congestion.
The ureters appear as small, clear tubes and may be difficult to see. However, if urates are present, the ureters may be easier to locate. No urates (white deposits as seen in the photos) should be present in the kidneys or ureters.

## Bursa of Fabricius

After removing the intestinal tract, the
bursa of fabricius can be located near
the cloaca. This lymphoid organ is
important for immunity and antibody
production in chickens. The size may
vary based on the age of the bird and
the vaccination program used for
Gumboro (Infectious Bursal Disease).
The bursa will normally decrease in size
as the bird ages and may be difficult to
locate in older birds.
!\[Image description\](Image of an anatomical dissection labeled '1' showing the location of the Bursa.)
On post-mortem inspection, the bursa
will appear as a small, round, pale-
colored sac.
!\[Image description\](Image of an anatomical dissection labeled '2' showing the Bursa.)
!\[Image description\](Image of an anatomical dissection labeled '3' showing the Bursa.)
After opening it, you should see several
small folds inside the bursa. Evaluate
the bursa for irregular size (e.g. much
smaller than expected for the age
of the bird), swelling (e.g. presence of edema and
folds may not be present if bursa is swollen), and
irregular coloring (e.g.: small pin-point blood spots
or hemorrhages).
In young birds, the bursa can also be examined and
removed in post-mortem birds by carefully cutting
the skin on the dorsal side just above the tail.
!\[Image description\](Image of an anatomical dissection labeled '4' showing the Bursa.)

## 5.6 Female Reproductive Tract

In the female reproductive system, only the left ovary will develop and mature. The ovary is firmly attached to the back of the hen's abdominal wall very near the kidneys.

In mature hens, the ovary is a mass of sacs called follicles and each follicle contains a yellowish ovum (or yolk). The follicle and yolk grow over a 10-day period to the size of a yolk in a normal egg. In a mature follicle, there is an area without blood vessels (the stigma) where the follicle has split apart to release the yolk into the oviduct. If the follicle splits at a point other than the stigma, blood vessels may rupture and blood may be seen in the egg.

Approximately every 24 hours, one mature ovum from the ovaries is passed into the oviduct which lies along the backbone and connects the ovary to the cloaca. In mature hens, the oviduct is about 63.5 cm (26 inches) long and consists of the infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina, each with their own function.

## Cloaca

1. Inspect the cloaca for wounds, cleanness, or urate deposits.
2. For hens in production, check for prolapses. Predisposing factors include:
✓ Repeated pecking at the vent
✓ Exposed oviduct following egg laying fails to retract in hens with poor conditioning. (Over- conditioned hens often have insufficient elasticity and tone due to excessive fat; under- conditioned birds may have underdeveloped muscles that are necessary to cope with egg laying).

Ovary, Oviduct in Pullets

The left ovary can be seen after removing the heart, liver and intestinal tract. In young pullets, it is pale in color and situated next to the kidney.
Examine the ovary for size based on age. Make note of any signs of bleeding.
The oviduct is a tube-like organ that stretches from the ovary to the cloaca and lies along the backbone (in the picture a white dotted line is overlaying the oviduct). In pullets, the oviduct is a clear, small tube. Inspect the oviduct for developmental defects.
After the pullet is photo stimulated, the follicles will begin to develop and appear as a small dark colored cluster.

## Oviduct, Ovary in **Hens**

1. After evaluation of the heart and intestines, these organs can be removed. This will allow a full view of the reproductive organs (oviduct and left ovary with developed ovum) of the hen. Inspect the oviduct for developmental abnormalities, double follicles, vascularization and infections.

2. An oviduct that has been removed from a mature female is seen in the photo. One ovum is in the infundibulum at the start of the oviduct. This is where fertilization occurs. A second ovum is in the isthmus (where the shell membrane is added) at the end of the oviduct where it joins the uterus.

3. Remnants of the right ovary are shown in the photo. The right ovary is non-functional but can occasionally be seen as a clear, fluid- filled cyst called the Mullerian duct. Inspect this remnant for size and clear content.

Remove the follicles. Inspect for vascularization and degeneration of follicles.
Check follicles over 1 cm. The photo shows a hierarchy of ova. A good range is 6 to 8 follicles, \> 1 cm each, and increasing in size.
The stigma is the point of rupture of the follicle during ovulation. If the follicle splits at a point other than the stigma, blood vessels may rupture.

## Infundibulum in Hens

The infundibulum engulfs and pulls mature ova that have been released from a follicle into the oviduct.
Fertilization occurs after the ovum is in the infundibulum. Normal appearance is shown in the photos. If the infundibulum does not engulf the ovum, the ovum may be reabsorbed. If not reabsorbed, the ova can accumulate in the coelomic cavity and can lead to a syndrome known as an "internal layer".
An ovum has been released and the post-ovulatory follicle is visible. The post ovulatory follicle has a hormonal function. Normal appearance should be whitish red.

## Testes, Ducti Deferens

1. The male chicken has two testis, located on either side of the vertebral column, near the top of the kidneys, in the coelomic cavity. After removing the liver, heart and intestinal tract, the testes will be visible.

2. The testes are bean-shaped and light yellow or tan. They can be visualized in day-old male chicks and increase in size as the male grows and matures. In immature males, each testis is about the size of a grain of rice. In mature males, the size of the testes will be much larger as shown in the photo. Inspect the testes for symmetry, color and size (as it relates to bird age).

3. In the picture a white dotted line is overlaying the ducti deferens. While moving through the ductus, the sperm matures. Inspect the ducti deferens for any abnormalities and obstipation.

## Testes

During post-mortem sessions, male fertility can be assessed if the testes are removed and weighed together. This information should be assessed in combination with the body weight, body conformation and general physical appearance (comb color and size, vent coloration, feather condition, etc.) of the rooster.
After 30 weeks of age, the total testicular weight may decrease. However, for active roosters, the pair of testicles should always weigh \>25 grams.
Inspect the testicles for vascularization on the surface. Normal vascularization is shown in the photo.
Cut the testes cross-sectionally and inspect. A normal testis cross-section is shown in the photo.

## Spinal Examination

In some cases, examination of the spine may be necessary if mobility issues (lameness, paralysis) or spinal deformities (short stature, spinal curvature, arched back, prominent dorsal keel) are apparent upon external examination. Be sure to make note of any mobility issues or spinal deformities on your post-mortem form.

If abnormalities are apparent, it is suggested to collect tissue for both histology and bacteriology.

Please note that to view the spinal column, it is best to cut the vertebral column vertically. Making this cut through the vertebrae can be difficult without a large sharp knife or bone saw.

!\[Image description\](Diagram of a bird skeleton from the front.)

## 6.0 Spinal Examination

1. To view the spine, the breast plate must be completely removed and all the organs should be removed from the thoracic and coelomic cavities including the lungs and kidneys. After removal, it may be helpful to wash the carcass to remove blood and tissue. Inspect the spine for lesions. The ribs should be evenly spaced. Note any ribs that appear close together.

2. Using a knife or bone saw, cut across the spinal column vertically.

3. Split the spinal column open vertically. The spinal cord will be laying inside the vertebral column (as shown in the photo). It should be white in color and not appear pinched by any vertebrae.

4. There is only one free thoracic vertebra, the articulation point, between the anterior thoracic vertebrae (which are fused) and the posterior vertebrae (lumbar vertebrae are fused; see diagram). As such, the free thoracic vertebra is subject to greater mechanical stress, trauma, dislocation and infection than other vertebrae. Infections and dislocation of the vertebra at this position can lead to decreased mobility and paralysis.
