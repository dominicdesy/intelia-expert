## Cage Brooding Recommendations

## Transportation to the Farm

Use a truck designed for transportation of chicks from hatchery to farm.
Truck should be environmentally controlled, maintaining 26-29Â°C at 70% relative humidity (measured inside chick box); with a minimum air flow of 0.7 mÂ³ per minute.
Provide space between stacks of chick boxes for air flow.

## Chick Placement

Unload boxes quickly and gently place chicks in brooding area.
Brood chicks in groups from similar aged breeder flocks.
Start chicks in upper tiered cages which are usually warmer and brighter. Ensure there are no shadows on drinkers (30-50 lux at the level of the nipple).
Chicks from young breeder flocks should be placed in warmer and brighter areas of the house.

## House Preparation before Arrival of Chicks

Brooder house should be completely cleaned and disinfected well in advance of chick delivery. Confirm effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection with environmental swabs.
Allow 2 weeks minimum downtime between flocks.
For more information on house preparation and brooding management, see the âGrowing Management of Commercial Pulletsâ technical update at www.hyline.com.
Establish proper house temperature of 32-35Â°C (air temperature measured at chick level) and 60% humidity 24 hours before chick placement.
Pre-heat brooding houses prior to chick placement: 24 hours in normal climates, 48 hours in cool climates and 72 hours in cold climates.
Fill automatic feed line to its highest level and adjust chick guards. Allow access to the automatic feeder from the first day.
Bright light (30-50 lux) for up to 21 days helps chicks quickly find feed and water and adapt to the new environment.

## Brooding Management

Place feed on cage paper 0-3 days to encourage consumption. For beak-treated chicks, feed on paper for 0-7 days.
Place feed in front of permanent feeder to train chicks to move toward feeders.
Remove paper at 7-14 days of age to avoid build-up of feces.
Find optimum balance of temperature, humidity and ventilation rate for chick comfort.
Cage floors should not be slippery or sloped.
Use vitamins and electrolytes in chicks' water (avoid sugar-based products to prevent growth of microorganisms).
Chicks' body weight should double between arrival and 7 days of age.
Brood chicks in groups from similar aged breeder flocks.
Modify temperature as needed to meet chicks' comfort needs.
Adjust brooding temperature according to relative humidity. Lower temperature should be used with higher relative humidity.
For every 5 percentage point increase above 60% relative humidity, reduce brooding temperatures by 1Â°C.
After the first week, reduce temperature weekly 2-3Â°C until reaching 21Â°C.
Do not give cold water to chicks. Be careful when flushing water lines for chicks. Allow water time to warm up in the house so chicks are comfortable drinking.

## Lighting During Brooding Period

An intermittent lighting program is preferred. If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0-7 days, use 20 hours of light from 0-7 days.
Do not use 24 hours of light.
Bright light (30-50 lux) for up to 21 days helps chicks quickly find feed and water and adapt to the new environment.
If multiple ages of chicks are moved into the house, use the intermittent lighting program based on youngest chicks. Oldest chicks can have up to 14 days of intermittent lighting."
After 2-3 weeks, reduce light intensity and begin slow step-down lighting program (see Light Program for Light- Controlled Housing).

Establishes more natural behavior of rest and activity
May improve 7 day livability and pullet body weight
Some dark periods may be shortened or removed to accommodate work schedules

## Drinking Systems

360 degree nipples are strongly preferred. Nipple type in rearing and laying house (vertical vs. 360Â° nipples) should be the same.
Drinking water should be tested periodically for quality and cleanliness from source and end of the water line.
Flush water lines prior to chick arrival.
Flush water lines weekly during rearing and production periods.
Record daily flock water consumption. A drop in water consumption is often the first sign of a serious problem in the flock.

## Cup drinkers

## Nipple drinkers

!\[Image description\](Illustration of a cup drinker system with a chicken drinking from it. Text indicates that the cup level should be aligned with the chick's back.)
!\[Image description\](Illustration of a nipple drinker system with a chicken drinking from it. Text indicates that the nipple level should be aligned with the chick's head, and the water exits at a 360Â° angle.)
Cup drinkers should be manually filled during 0-3 days to train chicks to drink.
Open drinkers (bell, plasson, supplemental chick drinkers, trough) are easily contaminated and should be cleaned daily.
Adjust nipple water system pressure to create hanging drop to help chicks find water for 0-3 days and in layer house at transfer.
Splash cups are useful during brooding period and in hot climates.
Use only 360Â° activated nipples for hatchery beak-treated chicks.

## Beak Treatment / Trimming

(Check local regulations concerning use of beak trimming)

W-36 commercial layers can be successful without beak trimming in cage and cage-free environments where light intensities are well controlled.
Infrared beak treatment (IRBT) is the preferred method of beak modification for Hy-Line W-36 commercial layers.
If IRBT is not used, 7-10-day precision beak trimming is acceptable.
If necessary, re-trim at 6 weeks or 12-14 weeks of age.

## HATCHERY INFRARED BEAK TREATMENT (IRBT)

This provides efficient, uniform beak treatment.
Beak remains intact until 21-28 days of age when treated portion separates.
Use only 360Â° activated nipples for IRBT chicks, as well as supplemental chick drinkers.
For IRBT chicks, feed on paper for 7-10 days.
In open housing, IRBT treated pullets may need retrimming at 6 or 12-14 weeks.
For more information, see the "Infrared BeakTreatment" technical update at www.hyline.com.
!\[Image description\](Infrared beak treatment can be modified according to local conditions.)
!\[Image description\](Immediately following infrared beak treatment on day of hatch)
!\[Image description\](7 days after infrared beak treatment)

## Precautions when using IRBT or beak trimming birds:

Water intake and light intensity are the most important factors in the success of IRBT/beak trimming. Chicks require immediate and easy access to water.
Do not beak-trim sick or stressed birds.
Do not hurry; handle chicks carefully.
Provide vitamins and electrolytes containing vitamin K in drinking water 2 days before and 2 days after beak trimming.
Watch chicks after beak trimming to assess stress. Raise ambient temperature until birds appear comfortable and active.
Keep feed at the highest level for 7-10 days after beak trimming.
Use only well-trained crews.
Use 360Â° activated nipples, supplemental chick drinkers and splash cups to encourage drinking.

!\[Image description\](Beak trim)

## Growth and Development

Focus on pullet rearing programs to optimize growth and development.
The best predictor of future laying performance is the pullet's body weight and body type at the point of lay.
A pullet flock stimulated into egg production at the correct body weight (1230â1270 g) with uniformity higher than 90% performs best in the production period.
It is important to achieve 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 week body weight targets to ensure optimum development of the bird's body.
Manage feeding to achieve body weights 0â12 weeks in the upper range of the body weight standard. This will ensure good musculoskeletal and GIT development. Avoid high rates of body weight gains after 12 weeks to prevent excessive abdominal fat development.
Delay diet change if birds are underweight or have poor body weight uniformity.
Anticipate rapid rise in ambient temperature and adjust bird's diet accordingly. Birds will eat less when exposed to a rapid temperature increase. (See the âUnderstanding Heat Stress in Layersâ technical update at www.hyline.com.)
Stress periods require a change in diet formulation to ensure proper nutrient intake.
Increasing dietary fiber to 5â6% beginning with developer diet (after the flock has reached 950â970 g) can increase crop, gizzard and intestine development and capacity.

Requirements vary with type of equipment used and environmental conditions.

## Transfer to Laying House

The flock can be moved into the production facility at 15â16 weeks of age.
It is ideal to administer the last inactivated vaccines at least one week prior to transfer.
It is important that rearing and production cages use similar feed and water systems, to minimize stress.
Any sex slips (males) should be removed around 7 weeks and at transfer.
Supportive care to reduce stress, such as water-soluble vitamins, probiotics, vitamin C and increased dietary density,
should be used 3 days before and 3 days after transfer.
Weigh prior to transfer and monitor weight loss during transfer. Birds can lose up to 113 g of body weight during
transfer, but should recover this loss within one week.
Monitor flock water consumption frequently after transfer. Pre-transfer water consumption should be achieved within 6
hours after transfer to the laying house.
Brighten the lights for three days after transfer until birds settle in their new environment.
Inspect the flock and remove mortality daily.
If mortality exceeds 0.1% per week, perform necropsies and other diagnostics to determine cause(s) of mortality.
Transfer birds as quickly as possible to laying house. Transfer all birds the same day. Move early in the morning so birds
can keep to a normal daily routine.

## Enriched Cages

Enriched cages address some of the welfare concerns of layers in cages by providing more space with environment enrichment devices, such as perches, nest boxes, scratch areas and abrasive pads for beak and toe management.
Generally, bird group sizes range from 40â110 birds per cage.
As group size increases, there is more competition for feed and water space and less stable social groups. This could lead to behavioral problems like feather pecking and piling. Cage enrichments help prevent these behavioral problems.

## Alternative Systems

W-36 is an excellent choice for alternative management systems. For more information on managing Hy-Line varieties in barn, aviary and free range systems, see the [Alternative Systems Management Guide](http://www.hyline.com).

## Vaccination Recommendations

For more information on vaccination programs, see the \[Vaccination Recommendations\](Vaccination Recommendations) technical update at [www.hyline.com](http://www.hyline.com).

## Management Events for Commercial Layers

## AGES OF BODY WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS

Weigh separate groups of birds on each cage level due to temperature and environmental differences. If using enrichable or enriched cages, weigh all birds in the cage, in at least three locations (may be more than 100 birds).
Identify cages from the beginning and end of feed lines.
Mark cages and use the same cage every time body weight is monitored.
Weigh birds on the same day of the week and at the same time of day.

## 0-30 weeks

Weigh 100 birds individually every week.
Weigh birds in the same cages each time for best accuracy.
Calculate uniformity.

## 35-90 weeks

Weigh 100 birds individually every 5 weeks.
Weigh birds in the same cages each time for best accuracy.
Calculate uniformity.
When handling birds for body weights, assess:

Keel boneâstraightness and firmness
Breast muscle score
Body fat
External parasites
Clinical symptoms of disease

```
CALCULATING UNIFORMITY
Use individual bird weights.
Uniformity calculation tool is available at www.hyline.com.
```

## AGES OF SERA COLLECTION

For more information, see the "Proper Collection and Handling of Diagnostic Samples" technical update at www.hyline.com.

Collect 10-20 sera samples per flock for titer determination.

## 8 weeks

Assess early vaccination technique and disease exposure.

## 15 weeks

Collect sera before transfer to lay house to assess possible change in disease exposure.
It is common to not send sera to the laboratory and freeze for future analysis in event of disease outbreak on lay farm.

## 16-24 weeks

Collect sera at least 4 weeks after final inactivated vaccination to measure post- vaccination antibody response.
It is useful to assess disease challenge after transfer to lay farm.

## 30-80 weeks

Collect sera every 10 weeks.
It is useful for assessing disease exposure during the laying period.

## AGES TO MONITOR EGG WEIGHTS

Weigh 100 eggs collected from egg belts in front of randomly selected cages (may be the same cages used for body weight monitoring) to ensure even distribution of egg samples. Monitor egg weights on a specific day of the week within the same 3-hour time frame.

## Bird HandlingâBE GENTLE

Proper handling of birds during body weight measurements, blood collection, selection, vaccination, and transfer will reduce bird stress and prevent injuries.
Hold birds by both legs or both wings.
Return birds to cage or floor gently.
Use experienced personnel that have been trained in proper procedures of bird handling.
Continually observe crews for proper handling.

## Good Lighting Practices

Measure minimum light intensity at feeder on bottom tier cages, mid-way between lights.
Keep light bulbs clean to prevent loss of light intensity.
Prevent dark areas caused by too much distance between lights or burned-out light bulbs.
Position lights to minimize bright and dark areas in the house.
Shiny or white surfaces reflect light and increase light intensity.
Take local conditions into account which may require adaptations of lighting programs.
Light hours of rearing and production houses should be matched at transfer.
Light intensity should gradually increase 2 weeks before flock is transferred to the laying house (but not prior to 14 weeks of age). Final rearing house light intensity should match the laying house intensity.
Begin light stimulation when flock reaches the body weight target (1200-1250 g). Delay light stimulation if the flock is underweight or has poor uniformity.
Light stimulation period should extend into the peaking period. Achieve 16 hours of light at approximately 25 weeks.
Alternating the height of lights improves light distribution to all cage levels.

## Light Program for Light-Controlled Housing

| Gradual light increases up to 25 weeks of age, reaching 15-16 hours by end of lay, depending on the peak production achieved |

Light-controlled houses are those which use light traps around fans and air inlets and complete prevent the ingress of light from the outside. Houses that are not light controlled should use lighting programs for open-sided housing.
An intermittent lighting program for chicks is preferred. If not using an intermittent lighting program from 0-7 days, use 20 hours of light from 0-7 days.
"Lights on" time can be varied between houses in laying flocks to facilitate egg collection on multiple flock complexes.
If the laying flock has a large spread in hatch ages and/or poor uniformity, light stimulate the flock based on the youngest hatch date or lightest birds.
Up to 16 weeks use cool light (4000-6000 K).
During lay, use warm lights (2700-3500K) in laying flocks to ensure sufficient red spectrum light.

## Use of Shades in Open-Sided Housing

â¢ Shades are an effective way to decrease light intensity in an open-sided house. â¢ Shades must be porous to allow air flow through the curtain. â¢ Keep shades clean and free of dust to allow air flow. â¢ Use stir fans when using shades. â¢ Avoid direct sunlight on birds by using shades or roof overhangs. â¢ Black shades are preferred.

## Midnight Feeding / Lighting Program

â¢ Optional lighting technique that promotes greater feed consumption â¢ Used whenever more feed intake is desired in rearing or laying flocks â¢ Increases calcium absorption during night when most egg shell is formed â¢ Useful to increase feed intake during peak egg production â¢ Helps maintain feed consumption in hot climates â¢ Midnight feeding may increase feed intake 2-5 g/ day per bird

## Good Practices

â¢ Initiate the program by turning lights on for 1â2 hours in the middle of the dark period. â¢ Fill feeders before lights are turned on. â¢ There must be at least 3 hours of dark before and after the midnight feeding. â¢ Light provided during the midnight feeding is in addition to regular day length (i.e. 16 hours + midnight feeding). â¢ If midnight feeding is removed, reduce light gradually at a rate of 15 minutes per week.

## Water Quality

â¢ Good quality water must be available to birds at all times. â¢ Water and feed consumption are directly relatedâwhen birds drink less, they consume less feed and production quickly declines. â¢ As a general rule, healthy birds will consume 1.5â2.0 times more water than feed. This ratio increases in high ambient temperatures. â¢ Test water quality at least 1 time per year. The water source will determine the regularity of water testing. â Surface water requires more frequent testing, as it is more affected by season and rainfall patterns. - Closed wells taking water from aquifers or deep artesian basins will be more consistent in water quality, but are generally higher in dissolved mineral content. â¢ The presence ence of coliform bacteria is an indicator that the water source has been contaminated with animal or human waste.

## HY-LINE W-36 COMMERCIAL LAYERS

â¢ When collecting a well water sample, let the water run for 2 minutes prior to collecting the sample. Water samples should be kept below 10Â°C and submitted to the lab in less than 24 hours. â¢ Some water sources contain high levels of dissolved minerals such as calcium, sodium and magnesium. When this occurs, amounts of these minerals in water have to be considered when formulating feed. â¢ Ideal water pH is 5â7 to promote good water sanitation, increase feed consumption and improve upper gastrointestinal health. â¢ Less than optimum water quality can have a significant impact on intestinal health, which will lead to under utilization of nutrients in feed. â¢ A decrease in flock water consumption is often the first sign of health problems and production drops.

## Calcium Particle Size

| PARTICLE SIZE | STARTER, GROWER, DEVELOPER | FIRST EGG-PEAK | PEAK- 35 WEEKS | WEEKS 36-55 | WEEKS 56+ |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Fine (0-2 mm) | 100% | 50% | 50% | 40% | 30% |
| Coarse (2-4 mm) | | 50% | 50% | 60% | 70% |

The appropriate particle size depends on the solubility of limestone.
Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility.
Limestone dark in color is geologically older, containing more impurities (typically magnesium) and is generally lower in solubility and calcium availability.
Oyster shell and other marine shells are good sources of soluble calcium.

## Feed Particle Size (Grist)

A sieve shaker separates feed sample into categories based on particle size.

Use on the farm to check feed particle size from the feed millâsample taken on delivery or from feed bins.
Use to assess the uniformity of feed particle size throughout the feeding systemâsamples are taken from various points.

## Too many fine feed particles:

Feed intake and nutrient absorption decreases
Dust in house increases

## Too many coarse feed particles:

Birds selectively eat large particles
Risk of feed separation increases

For more information, see the âFeed Granulometryâ technical update at www.hyline.com.

## Best Practices

A 3â4 hour gap between mid-day feedings allows birds to consume fine particles. Daily consumption of fine feed particles is important for a balanced nutrient intake.
Add a minimum of 0.5% liquid oil/fat in mash diets to incorporate and retain small particles in feed.
Use larger particle size meal or crumble to increase intakes in hot climates.

## Vitamins and Trace Minerals

As the vitamin / trace mineral premix is often found in fine feed particles, a minimum level of 0.5% added liquid oil / fat in mash diets binds small particles in feed.

At housing, an ambient temperature of 18-20Â°C is desired. Increase house temperature about 1Â°C every 2 weeks until reaching 25Â°C, assuming ventilation systems are able to maintain adequate air quality at these temperatures.
Lower (colder) house temperatures after peak will lead to greater feed intakes and may be counterproductive to egg-weight control, as well as optimal feed efficiency and adult hen body weights.
Place temperature sensors to measure temperature inside of cage. The temperature in walkways is significantly colder than the temperature inside cages, especially in stack deck belted house systems.
High environmental temperatures have a depressing effect on feed intake.

## Controlling Egg Weight

Closely monitor egg weight of each flock and make nutritional changes as needed to ensure optimal egg weight.
If smaller eggs are desired, egg weight should be controlled at an early age.
Egg-weight control is achieved by limiting amino acid consumption and ensuring that feed intake is not too high.
Monitor egg weight every 2 weeks until 35 weeks of age, then every 5 weeks. Start controlling egg weight when average egg weight is within 2 g of target.

Â¹ All nutrient requirements are based on the feed ingredient table at the back of this guide.

Â² Do not feed Pre-Lay Diet earlier than 15 weeks of age. Do not feed Pre-Lay later than first egg as it contains insufficient calcium to support egg production. Implementing a pre-lay diet can be challenging in mixed-age flocks. If it's not possible to use the Pre-Lay diet, the calcium content of the last stage rearing diet (developer) must be increased to 1.4%.

Â³ Recommended energy range is based on raw material energy values shown in feed ingredient table at back of this guide. It is important that target concentrations of dietary energy are adjusted according to energy system applied to raw material matrix.

â´Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed.

âµ Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw materials used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only.

â¶Calcium should be supplied as fine calcium carbonate (mean particle size less than 2 mm). Coarse limestone (2â4 mm) can be introduced in Pre-Lay Diet at up to 50% of total limestone.

â· Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.

â¸ Oil levels can be increased to 2.0% in starter diets when given as a mash to control dust and increase feed palatability.

â¹Avoid excessive body weight gain after 12 weeks.

## Pre-Lay Ration

Plan to feed for a
maximum of 10â14
days before point of lay.
Feed when most pullets
show reddening of
combs.
It is important to
increase medullary
bone reserves.
Begin introducing large
particle calcium in Pre-Lay Diet.
Discontinue pre-lay
feeding with the
commencement of egg
production.

## Transition Period

Avoid excessive weight gain during
the transition period.
Body weight gain from 18-25 weeks
should not exceed 20%.
Occurring during the transition
period:
Rapidly increasing egg production
Increasing egg size
Increasing body weight
Feed consumption may increase
slowly during transition:
In underweight birds
In flocks lacking uniformity
During high environmental
temperatures
Poor uniformity prolongs the
transition period and may result in
low peak and poor persistency of egg
production.
Monitor feed intake carefully during
transition and adjust dietary nutrient
concentration according to actual feed
intakes.

## Pre-Peaking Ration

Formulations for low
feed intakes (80-85
g/day/bird) should
be given as the flock
enters egg production
to better meet nutrient
requirements.
Begin Pre-Peaking Diet
with onset of lay (1%
egg production).
Pre-Peaking Diet is
given until average feed
consumption reaches
95 g/day/bird.

## Peaking Ration

Birds should continue to
grow during peaking period.
Poor nutrition during this
period can lead to loss of
body weight and soft bones.
Feed intake may be reduced
if birds are not accustomed
to extra large particle
calcium (i.e. not using a
Pre-Lay Diet).
Monitor keel bone
development during
the peaking period. For
more information on
keel bone scoring, see
the "Understanding the
Role of the Skeleton in
Egg Production" technical
update at www.hyline.com.

\-Change diet based on % of production and egg size Â¹ All nutrient requirements are based on the feed ingredient table at the back of this guide. 2 Crude protein, methionine+cystine, fat, linoleic acid, and / or energy may be changed to optimize egg size. 3 Peaking nutrient levels are calculated for birds at peak egg production. Prior to achieving peak egg production, the nutrient requirements will be lower. 4 A good approximation of the influence of temperature on energy needs is that for each 0.5Â°C change higher or lower than 22Â°C, subtract or add about 1.8 kcal /bird /day, respectively. 5 Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized Ileal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed.

* Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only. 7 Calcium and available phosphorus requirements are determined by flock age. When production remains higher and diets are fed for longer than ages shown, it is recommended to increase to calcium and phosphorus concentrations of next feeding phase. \* Calcium carbonate particle size recommendation varies throughout lay. Refer to Calcium Particle Size Table. Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility. Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.

1 All nutrient requirements are based on the feed ingredient table at the back of this guide. 2 Crude protein, methionine+cystine, fat, linoleic acid, and / or energy may be changed to optimize egg size. 3 Peaking nutrient levels are calculated for birds at peak egg production. Prior to achieving peak egg production, the nutrient requirements will be lower. \* A good approximation of the influence of temperature on energy needs is that for each 0.5Â°C change higher or lower than 22Â°C, subtract or add about 1.8 kcal/bird/day, respectively. 5 Recommendation for Total Amino Acids is only appropriate to corn and soybean meal diet. Where diets utilize other ingredients, recommendations for Standardized lleal Digestible Amino Acids must be followed. \* Diets should always be formulated to provide required intake of amino acid. Concentration of crude protein in diet will vary with raw material used. Crude protein value provided is an estimated typical value only. 7 Calcium and available phosphorus requirements are determined by flock age. When production remains higher and diets are fed for longer than ages shown, it is recommended to increase to calcium and phosphorus concentrations of next feeding phase. â¢ Calcium carbonate particle size recommendation varies throughout lay. Refer to Calcium Particle Size Table. Dietary calcium levels may need to be adjusted based on limestone solubility. Where other phosphorus systems are used, diets should contain recommended minimum level of available phosphorus.

## Disease Control

A flock of pullets or layers can only perform up to its genetic potential when disease influence is minimized. The diseases of economic importance vary widely between locations, but in every case the challenge is to identify and control those diseases.

## Biosecurity

Biosecurity is the best method of avoiding diseases. A good biosecurity program identifies and controls the most likely ways a disease could enter the farm.

Human and equipment movement onto the farm should be strictly controlled.
Visitors to the farm should be limited to those essential for its operation.
Visits should be documented in a logbook.
All visitors and workers should shower at a central location before entering.
Clean boots, clothing and head cover should be provided for workers and visitors.
Clean footbaths containing disinfectant should be placed outside entries to all poultry houses.
If possible, avoid using outside crews or equipment for vaccination, moving, and beak trimming.
Ideally, workers should be limited to a single house.
For those visiting a number of flocks, flocks visited on one day should be limited. Always progress from younger to older and from healthy to sick flocks. After visiting a sick flock, no other houses should be entered.
Removal of flocks from the farm is an opportunity for disease to be introduced, as trucks and crews have often been on other farms.
A single-aged rearing farm using an all-in, all-out principle is best to prevent transmission of disease from older flocks to younger, susceptible flocks.
Houses should be designed to prevent exposure to wild birds, insects and rodents.
Quickly and properly dispose of dead chickens.

## Rodents

Rodents are known carriers of many poultry diseases and the most common reason for re-contamination of a cleaned and disinfected poultry facility. They are also responsible for house-to-house spread of disease on a farm.

The farm should be free of debris and tall grass that provide a hiding area for rodents.
The perimeter of each house should have a 1 m wide area of crushed rock or concrete to prevent rodents from burrowing into the house.
Feed and eggs should be stored in rodent-proof areas.
Bait stations should be placed throughout the house and maintained with fresh rodenticide.

## Cleaning and Disinfection

Cleaning and disinfection of the house between flocks reduces infection pressure for the next flock.

Allow a minimum of 2 weeks downtime between flocks.
All feed and manure should be removed from the house before cleaning.
Thoroughly clean air inlets, fan housing, fan blades and fan louvers.
Heating the house during washing improves the removal of organic matter.
The house should be cleaned of organic matter with a high-pressure spray of warm water.
Use foam / gel detergent to soak into organic matter and equipment.
Wash the upper portion of the house before the pit.
Use high pressure warm water to rinse.
Allow the house to dry.
After it is fully dry, apply foam / spray disinfectant followed by fumigation.
Flush and sanitize water lines.
The monitoring of poultry houses for the presence of *Salmonella*, particularly *Salmonella enteritidis*, by routine environmental testing is recommended.
Allow the house to dry before repopulating.

## Vertically Transmitted Diseases

Some diseases are known to be transmitted from infected breeders to progeny.

Disease-free breeders are the first step in control of these diseases for commercial layers.
All breeders directly under Hy-Line International's control are free of lymphoid leukosis, *Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, Salmonella pullorum, Salmonella gallinarum, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium* and other *Salmonella* species.
Due to the possibility of horizontal transmission of these diseases, later generations may not remain free.

It is the responsibility of breeding and commercial flock owners to prevent horizontal transmission of these diseases and to continue testing to be assured of a negative status.

!\[Image description\](Hy Line. LAYERS STOP DO NOT ENTER THIS IS A BIOSECURE AREA)

## COCCIDIA

This parasitic infection of the intestines may lead to gut damage and, in severe infestations, death. More commonly, poor control of sub-clinical infection reduces feed conversion or leaves pullets with chronic, irreversible gut damage. Pullet flocks may be uneven or underweight at housing and not perform to their full potential in lay. Control of coccidia includes the following measures (check local regulations):

Use ionophores or chemicals on a step-down program to ensure immunity in pullets.
Live vaccine use is an alternative to anti-coccidial drug treatments.
Live vaccines are available that can be administered by spray in the hatchery or by feed or water application during the first few days in the brooder house.
Control of flies and beetles, which are vectors of coccidia spread.
Thorough cleaning and disinfection of houses reduces challenge pressure.
Limit bird access to manure belts.
Cocci vaccines require cycling; discuss this with the vaccine manufacturer.
