Glossary\n\nThe Optimum Broiler Development Guide is intended as a reference and supplement to your own flock management skills so that you can apply your knowledge and judgment to obtain consistently good results with the Cobb family of products.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Group of baby chicks)\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nIt is crucial for broiler performance to ensure a proper development of the chick (incubation + first 10 days of grow-out) especially because the chick does not have the ability to properly control its body temperature ('Cold Blooded') during this period.\n\nWinter temperatures pose an additional challenge to the development of chick and the subsequent adult broiler. This is mainly due to poor temperature control and also to compromised ventilation in the broiler houses. Good stockmen have the responsibility to maintain a good environment for the chick to maximize the birds' genetic potential.\n\n| Incubation | Broiler House |\n| ---------- | ------------- |\n| 0 5 10 15 21/0 | 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 |\n| \"Cold Blooded\" | \"Warm Blooded\" |\n| Development | Growth |\n\n## Objectives\n\nReview all the management aspects, in a check list form, that will help maintain broiler performance from the hatchery to the broiler house.\nDefine a few practical measurements that will indicate a successful incubation/brooding and a well developed broiler:\nChick quality measurements\nChick check\n7-day mortalities\n7-day weights\n!\\[Image description\\](A photo of many small chicks crowded together on the ground.)\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.1. Why focus on incubation?\n\n• Today's meat yield birds can produce higher embryonic temperatures and the risk of embryos overheating is higher. Research trials have shown that adverse incubation conditions can affect performance at different stages of the broiler cycle.\n\n• Hatchery ventilation and incubation temperatures must be able to cope with this or serious damage can be done to the chicks.\n\n• Less active, weaker chicks will show poorer starts and final performance. This will be especially true if brooding/growing conditions are challenging (winter).\n\n| Kjoules/egg/day | Watts/1000 eggs |\n| --------------- | --------------- |\n| 21.6 | 250 |\n| 17.28 | 200 |\n| 12.96 | 150 |\n| 8.64 | 100 |\n| 4.32 | 50 |\n| 0 | 0 |\n\n| Age (days) |\n| ---------- |\n| 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 |\n\nPoor chicks Good chicks\n\n| Heat Production (mW/egg) |\n| ------------------------ |\n| 180 |\n| 160 |\n| 140 |\n| 120 |\n| 100 |\n| 80 |\n| 60 |\n| 40 |\n| 20 |\n| 0 |\n\n| Embryonic heat output from different egg sizes |\n| ---------------------------------------------- |\n| |\n| 70 g (0.15 lb) |\n| 56 g (0.12 lb) |\n\n| Days of incubation |\n| ------------------ |\n| 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 |\n\n## 1.

How to establish good chick quality?\n\nTraditional chick grading standards (right), are done visually and damage done to the chicks from overheating are not obvious to select out by grading operatives.\nResearch from Wineland and Hulet indicate that overheated chicks can show the following symptoms:\nWeakness, tiredness\nWill be smaller (shorter)\nDehydration\nSmaller hearts, digestive system and less developed immune systems\nMore prone to bacterial infections (E.Coli)\nMore leg problems\n| Broiler Chick Grading Guide |\n| --------------------------- |\n| Perfect Chick |\n| cobb-vantress.com |\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.21. How to establish good chick quality? - Cleanliness of hatch debris\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\nExcess meconium residues on egg shells is a good indication that chicks have hatched too early and stayed too long on the hatcher baskets.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of hatchery with a label that says 'Adequate')\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of hatchery with a label that says 'Too dirty')\nAnother indicator of overheating or chicks being hatched for too long is:\nleg veins visible/protruding (left).\nif you crush empty eggshells in your hand, the shell separates completely from the membrane (right).\n!\\[Image description\\](Image of hatched eggshells)\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.22. How to establish good chick quality? - Color and strength\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Two chicks, one standing and the other pecking the ground.)\nStrong, alert chicks\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Many chicks together.)\nWeak chicks\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A hand holding many chicks together.)\nChicks should be bright yellow. Overheated chicks have poorly absorbed yolk sacs and hence pigments and are whiter than normal. *Caution: Formaldehyde masks white chicks*\nChicks should stand up and be active. If placed on their backs they should turn themselves within 3 seconds.\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.23. How to establish good chick quality? - Feathering\n\nGood feather development is synonymous of good chick development during\nincubation (chicks must look fluffy!).\nHowever, excess development of the wing feathers does indicate early hatching\n(overheating) and excessive time in the hatcher baskets.\n!\\[Image description\\](Close-up of feathers on the wing of a chicken. Labelled 'Correct development')\n!\\[Image description\\](Close-up of poor feather development on the wing of a chicken. Labelled 'Well advanced (open), hatched too early')\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.24. How to establish good chick quality? - Colibacillosis control\n\n• This is the most common infectious disease of poultry and is world wide in incidence.\n\n• Infection is via the oral route, via the shell membrane, yolk/navel, water and the incubation period is 3-5 days.\n\n• Poor navel healing, mucosal damage due to viral infections and immunosuppressive challenges are pre-disposing factors to infections.\n\n| Egg condition | Total bacteria | Coliforms | 14 day mortality |\n| ------------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------------- |\n| Clean | 600 | 123 | 0.9 |\n| Soiled | 20,000 | 904 | 2.3 |\n| Dirty | 80,000 | 1,307 | 4.1 |\n\n(J.

How to establish good chick quality? - Colibacillosis control\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Cobb logo)\nTreatment is by antibiotic treatment and the type of product used depends on resistance of the bacteria isolated.\nContaminated hatch debris and chick fluff in the hatchery are major sources of bacterial infection.\nPrevention includes good hygiene of hatching eggs and good hygiene in the hatchery.\nGood hygiene on the farm at depletion is also important because the bacteria are readily killed by disinfection.\nWater hygiene is also potentially important and chlorine at 3 ppm is a good option (water ph dependant (ph \\<7)).\nFumigation in the hatchers with formalin has shown good results in reducing bacterial load.\n| Duration | Solutions | Volume |\n| -------- | --------- | ------ |\n| From transfer to six hours before take off | Formalin can either be applied neat concentrate (36% - 38%) or diluted 1:1 with water (final formalin solution of 18 - 19%) | 60 ml of solution per m³ of hatcher space (2.03 oz per 35 ft³), in pans with surface area of 50 cm²/m³ (7.75 in² per 35.3 ft³). Volumes need to be adjusted for neat concentrate formalin. |\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.3. What to measure? - Embryo temperatures\n\n• Embryo temperatures - can be measured accurately by taking egg shell temperatures, on fertile eggs at the egg's equator with a thermoscan thermometer between 16 and 18 days of incubation.\n\nThis will highlight how uniform the temperature is inside the incubator and locate any adverse 'hot' or 'cold' spots, as seen in the contour graph below.\n\nInfertile eggs must not be measured as they have 0.5 -1.7°C (2 - 3° F) lower egg shell temperatures than fertile eggs.\n\nContour graph showing variance of egg shell temperatures in a multi-stage incubator between tray positions Measuring zone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 37.78 - 38.89°C 38.89 - 40°C 40 - 41.11°C (100 - 102°F) (102 - 104°F) (104 - 106°F) Top Middle Bottom\n\n| Embryo Temp | Qualification | Consequences |\n| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |\n| 36.7 - 37.7°C (98.1 - 99.9°F) | Too cold | Slow hatch |\n| 37.8 - 38.1°C (100.0 - 100.6°F) | Optimum | Good hatch and chick quality |\n| 38.1 - 39.2°C (100.6 - 102.6°F) | Too warm | Good hatch, poorer chick quality |\n| 39.2 - 40.0°C (102.6 - 104.0°F) | Too hot | Poor hatch and chick quality |\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.3. What to measure? - Embryo temperatures\n\n• Effect of incubation temperature on hatchability and chick quality can be seen in the graphs below.\n\nFactors affecting uniformity of incubation temperatures: a. Incorrect ventilation - air volume supply, pressures, damper settings, exhaust ventilation, etc. b. Temperature calibrations c. Cooling problems - water flow rates, valves stuck open, water temperature (too hold/cold), scale in pipes, etc. d. Over/under utilization of setting capacities e. Physics of air movement/design by manufacturer f. Incorrect setting patterns g. Maintenance - poor door seals h. Maintenance - correct turning angle\n\n| Incubation Temperature | Hatch % |\n| ---------------------- | ------- |\n| 36.94°C (98.5°F) | 87.0 |\n| 37.78°C (100.0°F) | 89.0 |\n| 38.89°C (102.0°F) | 91.0 |\n\n| Incubation Temperature | Cull % |\n| ---------------------- | ------ |\n| 36.94°C (98.5°F) | 2.0 |\n| 37.78°C (100.0°F) | 0.5 |\n| 38.89°C (102.0°F) | 1.0 |\n\n## 1.

What to measure? - Hatch window\n\nHatch Window Targets are for the chicks to hatch: Max. 25%, 24 hours prior to pull Max. 75%, 12 hours prior to pull These targets are more critical for chicks being transported over long distances or time delays from hatch to delivery.\n\n| % Hatched - IDEAL - Top | % Hatched - IDEAL - Middle | % Hatched - IDEAL - Bottom |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| | | |\n| | | |\n\n| % Hatched - TOO EARLY - Top | % Hatched - TOO EARLY - Middle | % Hatched - TOO EARLY - Bottom |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |\n| | | |\n| | | |\n\n| Incubation temperature effect on hatching times - % of Chicks Hatched |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| |\n| |\n| |\n| |\n| |\n| |\n| |\n\nThe graph shows the influence of incubation temperatures on hatching times (hatch window).

Hatchery\n\n## 1.31. What to measure? - Hatch window\n\nThe Hatch Window can influence - • chick weight • residual yolk % • chick length Chick weight is the most important criteria from this list as high embryo temperatures cause early hatching, more risk of dehydration and subsequently a correlation to higher early broiler mortality.\n\n| Incubation temp. | Hatching times | Chick wt (g/oz) at hatching from shell | Chick wt (g/oz) at take-off | Weight loss (g/oz) | Weight loss % |\n| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |\n| 36.94°C (98.5°F) | 1 - Early | 44.01/1.55 | 39.85/1.41 | 4.16/0.15 | 9.45 |\n| 36.94°C (98.5°F) | 1 - Late | 44.55/1.57 | 42.47/1.50 | 2.08/0.07 | 4.67 |\n| 37.78°C (100.0°F) | 3 - Early | 42.06/1.48 | 36.94/1.30 | 5.12/0.18 | 12.17 |\n| 37.78°C (100.0°F) | 3 - Late | 44.22/1.56 | 40.78/1.44 | 3.44/0.12 | 7.78 |\n| 38.89°C (102.0°F) | 5 - Early | 43.46/1.53 | 38.25/1.35 | 5.21/0.18 | 11.99 |\n| 38.89°C (102.0°F) | 5 - Late | 44.22/1.56 | 40.26/1.42 | 3.96/0.14 | 8.95 |\n\n| Weight Loss (g) | (g) (oz) | Effect of incubation temp on chick weight loss from emergence from the shell to take-off |\n| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| | | |\n| | 14.0 0.49 | |\n| | 12.0 0.42 | |\n| | 10.0 0.35 | |\n| | 8.0 0.28 | |\n| | 6.0 0.21 | |\n| | 4.0 0.14 | |\n| | 2.0 0.07 | |\n| | 0 | |\n| | 1-Early | 1-Late 3 Early 3Late 5-Early 5- Late |\n| | 36.94°C (98.5°F) | 37.78°C (100.0°F) 38.89°C (102.0°F) |\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.32. What to measure? - Chick yield %\n\nChick yield is expressed as chick weight as a percentage of the initial egg weight. The old rule of thumb was that chicks weighed approximately two thirds of egg weight or 67%.\n\nWith many incubators today, especially single stage machine, the damper is closed in the early days to aid uniformity of temperature and development of the chorioallantoic membranes. This restriction of ventilation can affect the moisture weight loss of the egg and impact this chick yield %.\n\nResearch trials have shown that chick yield % can correlate to broiler 7 day mortality and bodyweights, especially in anti-biotic free environments. Excess moisture/fluid accumulation can be more susceptible to bacterial infection, especially with any stress factors to the day-old chicks.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A picture showing moisture weight loss at 18 days of incubation)\nGood Bad Ideal chick yield % should be 66 - 68%\n\n| 7 Day Mortality (%) | Correlation between chick yield and 7 day mortality | Temp °F |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| 4.0 | | ■101.5 |\n| 3.5 | | ■ 100.0 |\n| 3.0 | | ■98.5 |\n| 2.5 | | |\n| 2.0 | | |\n| 1.5 | | |\n| 1.0 | | |\n| 0.5 | | |\n| 0 | | |\n| | 65 | |\n| | 67 | |\n| | 69 | |\n| | Chick Yield (%) | |\n\n| 7 Day Weights (g) | Correlation between chick yield and 7 day weights | Temp °F |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| 180 | | ■ 101.5 |\n| 175 | | ■100.0 |\n| 170 | | ■98.5 |\n| 165 | | |\n| 160 | | |\n| 155 | | |\n| 150 | | |\n| | 65 | |\n| | 67 | |\n| | 69 | |\n| | Chick Yield (%) | |\n\n## 1. Hatchery\n\n## 1.33. What to measure? - Cloaca temperatures\n\nChick internal temperature should be maintained at 40.0 - 40.6°C (104-105.08°F). The temperature should be measured gently inside the cloaca.\nChicks lose 3 g (0.007 lb) of moisture from the feathers which act as a cooling mechanism.\nChick internal rectal temperature can be measured at take-off or in the chick holding room,\nbut only when the chicks are dry and internal body temperature is stabilized i.e. not directly after spray vaccination.\n\nChick internal temperature above 41°C (105.8°F) will lead to panting.\nChick internal temperature below 40.0°C (104°F) is too cold.\n!\\[Image description\\](A close-up shot of a person's hands administering an injection to a small chick.

Test the effectiveness of how well the house is sealed by closing all the inlets, then open a door slightly ajar or crack open an inlet with one fan with a capacity 18 CMH/sq m of floor area (CFM/ft²) running → should record a\npressure in excess of 37.5 pascals (.151 inches of water) at the inlet. If \\< 25 pascals (.10 inches of water), it indicates that the house is poorly sealed.\n\nUse plastic sheeting on outside and inside of doors to seal.\n!\\[Image description\\](Thermal imaging showing temperature variation in a building.

Brooding\n\n## 3.1. Ventilation\n\nMinimum ventilation controls air quality via fans which must work on a timer and inlets controlled by pressure and both independent of temperature control. The minimum ventilation system operates any time the house temperature is at or below the house set point temperature.\nThe timer should provide a minimum air exchange value of 12.5% (1/8) of house volume. The minimum run time needs to be at least 60 seconds to ensure that the incoming cold, outside air has properly mixed and heated with the internal air before reaching chick level.\nInlets are vital in achieving good air volume and uniform air distribution.\nThe inlets should completely seal when closed.\nThe inlets should react to the fans and work on pressure, NOT on percentage of opening or temperature.\nThe inlet capacity should match the fan capacity at the fans working pressure based on the width of the house.\nAutomatic calculation of minimum ventilation requirements for your house can be made on our website www.cobb-vantress.com\n!\\[Image description\\](A photo of a small chick standing near a water source.

Brooding\n\n## 3.2. Relative humidity\n\n## Controlling relative humidity\n\nThe main aim of controlling relative humidity is maintaining dry friable litter.\nWet or capped litter will lead to increased carcass issues such as podo-dermatitis and hock burn and in extreme situations even breast blisters.\nCarcass downgrades is also used as a measurement of bird welfare. Failure to meet minimum requirements will lead to reduced stocking density that is permitted.\nMoisture is produced by the heating system, drinking system and the birds.\nTo control relative humidity the only option is to increase the air temperature approximately for every 1°C (1.8°F) we heat the air the relative humidity of the air is reduced by 5%.\nWarm air is lighter than cold air and the warmest air in the building is closest to the ceiling.\nThe longer we can keep the outside cold air close to the ceiling the better the opportunity of increasing the temperature of that air and therefore reducing its relative humidity.\nThe lower the relative humidity of the air at any temperature the larger the potential of that air to carry (soak up) moisture from the environment.\n70 - 75% of the water consumed by the bird will be excreted to the air or the litter. It is the job of the ventilation system to remove and prevent a moisture build up in the house.\n\n## 3. Brooding\n\n## 3.2. Relative humidity\n\nHow to keep floors dry\n\nReduce relative humidity!\n1°C (1.8°F) increase in air temperature = 5% RH reduction.\nHeated air expands and holds more moisture.\nThe more we warm the incoming air from its outside temperature the bigger the moisture holding capacity of the air increases.\nThe best results from reducing air relative humidity are when there is a big difference between inside and out temperature.\nBetter reduction in relative humidity - winter time, during brooding.\nLess effective reduction in relative humidity - summer time, when the birds are older and in warm climates.\n!\\[Image description\\](Logo of Cobb.)\nThe warmest air is closest to the ceiling\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Thermal camera image showing temperature gradients in a brooding house, with numbered temperature readings overlaid.)\n| °C (°F) | H₂O - g/m³/lb/ft³ | % RH | New % RH |\n| ------- | ----------------- | ---- | -------- |\n| 0°C (32°F) | 4.86/ 0.00030 | 100 | 15 |\n| 3°C (37°F) | 5.98/0.00037 | 100 | 19 |\n| 5°C (41°F) | 6.84/ 0.00042 | 100 | 22 |\n| 7°C (45°F) | 7.81/0.00048 | 100 | 25 |\n| 10°C (50°F) | 9.490.00059 | 100 | 30 |\n| 12°C (54°F) | 10.78/ 0.00067 | 100 | 34 |\n| 15°C (59°F) | 13.02/ 0.00081 | 100 | 41 |\n| 20°C (68°F) | 17.66 / 0.00110 | 100 | 56 |\n\n## 3.

Water\n\n• Water spillage and wastage should be kept to a minimum especially in winter time because of lower air exchange during these months.\n\n• Ideally at placement a bead of water should be visible on the end of the nipple to encourage water consumption-this is achieved by setting the pressure low in the drinking system. After the first hours and once you are sure that water consumption has been adequately achieved in the flock, turn the pressure setting in the drinking system up to prevent spillage and wet litter.\n\n• Chicks should not be encouraged to drink from the drip trays after the first day of placement - water easily becomes contaminated from the environment and wasted onto the litter.\n\n• Water consumption of 1 ml/bird (3.4 oz/100 chicks) per hour for the first twenty four hours after placement - minimum.\n\n• Maintain litter moisture between 25-35% under the drinking system, reduce pressure if litter becomes damp.\n\n• Place drinker lines at a height that the birds have to stretch slightly to reach.\n\n• Ideal water temperature is between 10-14°C (50-57°F), however birds can tolerate a wide range of water temperature; even so water temperature should never be allowed to be less than 5°C (41°F) or greater than 25°C (77°F). If this occurs the drinking system must be flushed.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Thermal image showing water temperature at spot 1 (34.3°C / 93.7°F) and spot 2 (37.0°C / 98.6°F).

Water - Flow rate\n\nAlso we need to have sufficient flow rate from the nipple to aid water intake and therefore feed intake in the first week.\nIn fact chicks consume nearly three times the volume of water as feed during this period.\nAt day old a chick can apply a pressure of 3 g (0.007 lb) to the nipple so they can only activate the nipple from the side, at 9 10 days of age a chick can apply a pressure of 7 - 10 g (0.015 - 0.022 lb) so they can activate the nipple from the bottom.\n| | |\n| - | - |\n| Week 1 | 40 ml (1.35 oz)/min |\n| Week 2 | 50 ml (1.69 oz)/min |\n| Week 3 | 60 ml (2.03 oz)/min |\n| Week 4 | 70 ml (2.37 oz)/min |\n| Week 5 | 90 ml (3.04 oz)/min |\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A person is holding a tube with a transparent liquid inside.)\n\n## 3. Brooding\n\n## 3.6. Lighting\n\nLight intensity - at least 25 lux (2.32 foot candles) in the darkest place at floor level.\nLight intensity should not vary by more than 20% from brightest to darkest place at floor level.\nFluorescent lights should be installed at a minimum of one watt/m² (10.76 ft²) of floor area.\n!\\[Image description\\](Photograph of a poultry farm interior, showing a large number of chickens under artificial lighting.)\n\n## 3. Brooding\n\n## 3.7. Chick check\n\nThe main objective of management during the first hours after placement on the farm is to achieve as much intake of both feed and water in as many chicks as possible. Failure to achieve this objective will lead to irreversible compromised flock performance and will express itself as poor growth, poor feed conversion and poor flock uniformity.\n\nAn excellent indicator of floor temperature is the temperature of the chick's feet.\nIf the chick's feet are cold, the internal body temperature of the chick is also reduced.\nCold chicks will be seen huddling with reduced activity and resulting in reduced feed and water intake and therefore reduced growth rate.\nBy placing the feet against your neck or cheek one can readily learn how warm or cold the chick is.\nIf they are comfortably warm, the chicks should be evenly and actively moving around the brooding area.\nIf the crops of the chicks are checked eight hours after placement a minimum of 85% of examined chicks should have both feed and water present.\nA minimum of 95% of the bird's crops should be filled upon examination the morning after placement.\nSample 100 chicks per brood area.\nCheck: temperature of feet against neck or cheek.\nIf the feet are cold, re-evaluate pre-heating temperature.\nEvaluate crop fill and indicate results on form as below:\n| Crop fill | No. of chicks | Full - Pliable Feed \\& water | Full - Hard Only feed | Full - Soft Only water | Empty |\n| --------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |\n| Evaluation | | | | | |\n\n## 4.

This is mainly due to poor temperature control and also to compromised ventilation in the broiler houses. Good stockmen have the responsibility to maintain a good environment for the chick to maximize the birds' genetic potential.\n\n| Incubation | Broiler House |\n| ---------- | ------------- |\n| 0 5 10 15 21/0 | 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 |\n| \"Cold Blooded\" | \"Warm Blooded\" |\n| Development | Growth |\n\n## Objectives\n\nReview all the management aspects, in a check list form, that will help maintain broiler performance from the hatchery to the broiler house.\nDefine a few practical measurements that will indicate a successful incubation/brooding and a well developed broiler:\nChick quality measurements\nChick check\n7-day mortalities\n7-day weights\n!\\[Image description\\](A photo of many small chicks crowded together on the ground.)\n\n## 1.

    "## 1.1. Why focus on incubation?\n\n• Today's meat yield birds can produce higher embryonic temperatures and the risk of embryos overheating is higher. Research trials have shown that adverse incubation conditions can affect performance at different stages of the broiler cycle.\n\n• Hatchery ventilation and incubation temperatures must be able to cope with this or serious damage can be done to the chicks.\n\n• Less active, weaker chicks will show poorer starts and final performance. This will be especially true if brooding/growing conditions are challenging (winter).\n\n| Kjoules/egg/day | Watts/1000 eggs |\n| --------------- | --------------- |\n| 21.6 | 250 |\n| 17.28 | 200 |\n| 12.96 | 150 |\n| 8.64 | 100 |\n| 4.32 | 50 |\n| 0 | 0 |\n\n| Age (days) |\n| ---------- |\n| 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 |\n\nPoor chicks Good chicks\n\n| Heat Production (mW/egg) |\n| ------------------------ |\n| 180 |\n| 160 |\n| 140 |\n| 120 |\n| 100 |\n| 80 |\n| 60 |\n| 40 |\n| 20 |\n| 0 |\n\n| Embryonic heat output from different egg sizes |\n| ---------------------------------------------- |\n|  |\n| 70 g (0.15 lb) |\n| 56 g (0.12 lb) |\n\n| Days of incubation |\n| ------------------ |\n| 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 |\n\n## 1.

    "## 1.32. What to measure? - Chick yield %\n\nChick yield is expressed as chick weight as a percentage of the initial egg weight. The old rule of thumb was that chicks weighed approximately two thirds of egg weight or 67%.\n\nWith many incubators today, especially single stage machine, the damper is closed in the early days to aid uniformity of temperature and development of the chorioallantoic membranes. This restriction of ventilation can affect the moisture weight loss of the egg and impact this chick yield %.\n\nResearch trials have shown that chick yield % can correlate to broiler 7 day mortality and bodyweights, especially in anti-biotic free environments. Excess moisture/fluid accumulation can be more susceptible to bacterial infection, especially with any stress factors to the day-old chicks.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A picture showing moisture weight loss at 18 days of incubation)\nGood Bad Ideal chick yield % should be 66 - 68%\n\n| 7 Day Mortality (%) | Correlation between chick yield and 7 day mortality | Temp °F |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| 4.0 |  | ■101.5 |\n| 3.5 |  | ■ 100.0 |\n| 3.0 |  | ■98.5 |\n| 2.5 |  |  |\n| 2.0 |  |  |\n| 1.5 |  |  |\n| 1.0 |  |  |\n| 0.5 |  |  |\n| 0 |  |  |\n|  | 65 |  |\n|  | 67 |  |\n|  | 69 |  |\n|  | Chick Yield (%) |  |\n\n| 7 Day Weights (g) | Correlation between chick yield and 7 day weights | Temp °F |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| 180 |  | ■ 101.5 |\n| 175 |  | ■100.0 |\n| 170 |  | ■98.5 |\n| 165 |  |  |\n| 160 |  |  |\n| 155 |  |  |\n| 150 |  |  |\n|  | 65 |  |\n|  | 67 |  |\n|  | 69 |  |\n|  | Chick Yield (%) |  |\n\n## 1.

The temperature should be measured gently inside the cloaca.\nChicks lose 3 g (0.007 lb) of moisture from the feathers which act as a cooling mechanism.\nChick internal rectal temperature can be measured at take-off or in the chick holding room,\nbut only when the chicks are dry and internal body temperature is stabilized i.e. not directly after spray vaccination.\n\nChick internal temperature above 41°C (105.8°F) will lead to panting.\nChick internal temperature below 40.0°C (104°F) is too cold.\n!\\[Image description\\](A close-up shot of a person's hands administering an injection to a small chick.

Failure to meet minimum requirements will lead to reduced stocking density that is permitted.\nMoisture is produced by the heating system, drinking system and the birds.\nTo control relative humidity the only option is to increase the air temperature approximately for every 1°C (1.8°F) we heat the air the relative humidity of the air is reduced by 5%.\nWarm air is lighter than cold air and the warmest air in the building is closest to the ceiling.\nThe longer we can keep the outside cold air close to the ceiling the better the opportunity of increasing the temperature of that air and therefore reducing its relative humidity.\nThe lower the relative humidity of the air at any temperature the larger the potential of that air to carry (soak up) moisture from the environment.\n70 - 75% of the water consumed by the bird will be excreted to the air or the litter. It is the job of the ventilation system to remove and prevent a moisture build up in the house.\n\n## 3. Brooding\n",

Temperature\n\nThe minimum temperature for the first 14 days should not fall more than 1°C (1.8°F) below the set point.\nEnsure heaters have been serviced.\nCalibrate sensors before placement.\nEnsure you have adequate heating capacity.\nRadiant heating- ensure the correct number of chicks per heater.\nForced air heating - where winter outside minimum temperatures are above 0°C at least 0.07 kw/hour per cubic meter of house volume is required, and where the outside temperature is below zero, 0.10 kw/hour per cubic meter of house volume heating capacity.\nInstall back up thermometers to confirm environment.\nPlace sensors at bird height.\nChicks from pre-peak breeder flocks are smaller and have a higher need for external heat to maintain their optimal body temperature compared to larger chicks. Smaller chicks have increased surface to body weight ratio and therefore body heat loss is greater than larger chicks.\n| 7 Day Mortality % v Heating Capacity KW/m³ |\n| ------------------------------------------ |\n|  |\n\n| 7 Day Mortality % v Heating Capacity KW/m³ |\n| ------------------------------------------ |\n|  |\n\n| 7 Day Weight v Heating Capacity KW/m³ |\n| ------------------------------------- |\n|  |\n\n| Final Weight v Heating Capacity KW/m³ |\n| ------------------------------------- |\n|  |\n\n| 7 Day Weight v Heating Capacity KW/m³ |\n| ------------------------------------- |\n|  |\n\n| Final Weight v Heating Capacity KW/m³ |\n| ------------------------------------- |\n|  |\n\n## 3.

Water\n\n• Water spillage and wastage should be kept to a minimum especially in winter time because of lower air exchange during these months.\n\n• Ideally at placement a bead of water should be visible on the end of the nipple to encourage water consumption-this is achieved by setting the pressure low in the drinking system. After the first hours and once you are sure that water consumption has been adequately achieved in the flock, turn the pressure setting in the drinking system up to prevent spillage and wet litter.\n\n• Chicks should not be encouraged to drink from the drip trays after the first day of placement - water easily becomes contaminated from the environment and wasted onto the litter.\n\n• Water consumption of 1 ml/bird (3.4 oz/100 chicks) per hour for the first twenty four hours after placement - minimum.\n\n• Maintain litter moisture between 25-35% under the drinking system, reduce pressure if litter becomes damp.\n\n• Place drinker lines at a height that the birds have to stretch slightly to reach.\n\n• Ideal water temperature is between 10-14°C (50-57°F), however birds can tolerate a wide range of water temperature; even so water temperature should never be allowed to be less than 5°C (41°F) or greater than 25°C (77°F). If this occurs the drinking system must be flushed.\n\n!\\[Image description\\](Thermal image showing water temperature at spot 1 (34.3°C / 93.7°F) and spot 2 (37.0°C / 98.6°F).

    "## 3.51. Water - Flow rate\n\nAlso we need to have sufficient flow rate from the nipple to aid water intake and therefore feed intake in the first week.\nIn fact chicks consume nearly three times the volume of water as feed during this period.\nAt day old a chick can apply a pressure of 3 g (0.007 lb) to the nipple so they can only activate the nipple from the side, at 9 10 days of age a chick can apply a pressure of 7 - 10 g (0.015 - 0.022 lb) so they can activate the nipple from the bottom.\n|  |  |\n| - | - |\n| Week 1 | 40 ml (1.35 oz)/min |\n| Week 2 | 50 ml (1.69 oz)/min |\n| Week 3 | 60 ml (2.03 oz)/min |\n| Week 4 | 70 ml (2.37 oz)/min |\n| Week 5 | 90 ml (3.04 oz)/min |\n\n!\\[Image description\\](A person is holding a tube with a transparent liquid inside.)\n\n## 3. Brooding\n\n## 3.6. Lighting\n\nLight intensity - at least 25 lux (2.32 foot candles) in the darkest place at floor level.\nLight intensity should not vary by more than 20% from brightest to darkest place at floor level.\nFluorescent lights should be installed at a minimum of one watt/m² (10.76 ft²) of floor area.\n!\\[Image description\\](Photograph of a poultry farm interior, showing a large number of chickens under artificial lighting.)\n\n## 3. Brooding\n",
    "## 3.7. Chick check\n\nThe main objective of management during the first hours after placement on the farm is to achieve as much intake of both feed and water in as many chicks as possible. Failure to achieve this objective will lead to irreversible compromised flock performance and will express itself as poor growth, poor feed conversion and poor flock uniformity.\n\nAn excellent indicator of floor temperature is the temperature of the chick's feet.\nIf the chick's feet are cold, the internal body temperature of the chick is also reduced.\nCold chicks will be seen huddling with reduced activity and resulting in reduced feed and water intake and therefore reduced growth rate.\nBy placing the feet against your neck or cheek one can readily learn how warm or cold the chick is.\nIf they are comfortably warm, the chicks should be evenly and actively moving around the brooding area.\nIf the crops of the chicks are checked eight hours after placement a minimum of 85% of examined chicks should have both feed and water present.\nA minimum of 95% of the bird's crops should be filled upon examination the morning after placement.\nSample 100 chicks per brood area.\nCheck: temperature of feet against neck or cheek.\nIf the feet are cold, re-evaluate pre-heating temperature.\nEvaluate crop fill and indicate results on form as below:\n| Crop fill | No. of chicks | Full - Pliable Feed \\& water | Full - Hard Only feed | Full - Soft Only water | Empty |\n| --------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |\n| Evaluation |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n## 4. Ultimate performance indicators\n\n## 4.1. 7-day mortality/weights\n\nMortality percentage is a good indicator of chick quality, hatching process, house set up and early brooding management.\nMaximum seven day mortality should not exceed 1% cumulative.\nMeasuring seven-day weights will give an indication of how successful the brooding management has been.\nFailure to achieve good seven-day weights will mean an inferior result at the end of the growing cycle.\nFor every gram at day 7 we should target an increase to 11.8 g (0.03 lb) at 35 days.\n",
